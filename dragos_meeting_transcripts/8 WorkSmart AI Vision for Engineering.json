{"transcript":"# WorkSmart AI Vision for Engineering\n\n## Topics\n\n\n## Transcript\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:03:08.502Z)\nat the start has been done, although obviously that's an ongoing process to understand how we reinforce it, how we make sure people are compliant, and how do we identify further opportunities.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:03:24.856Z)\nJust stepping back for a second, I think there is something that we want to do differently, and I think you guys want to do differently as well, is that this is, I mean, we are in a so unique position that we have this tracker and we are getting all this information. And it bothers me so much that plus we build all this technology around it, right? And we're not using it, right? It just, it bothers me so much.\n\n And I really want to figure out how we can, I want to move this to like a tier one thing, right? Because, you know, in the past it was always like, well, here's the thing, you guys can take a look and we would always, you know, went and listened to Eric on chorus, right? Now, I also talked to Samy about this and I really think that we just need to pick one thing that we want to use this for in Q4 and try to try to figure out if this can do that.\n\n Now, when I told Samy that one thing, he's like, oh, I bet the current solution can provide that to you already, right? So I don't know, but maybe. So maybe I need to come up with a harder goal. But the issue that we have with Robert and other engine leaders is now we are almost 100% thanks to Khoros hiring and all this stuff. I wrote this in my budget document that 100 engineers, 100 AI workflows.\n\n Some, we're really good, probably. Some, pretty bad, probably. But we don't have The time, I don't know, we just didn't do it. But it's not like we understand how everyone is using AI and what their workflow is, all that stuff, right? But I told Robert that it bothers me so much that if a random person will send me an email that, hey, how do you guys use AI in Engineering? I would like, well, I know that we are really pushing everyone into their IDE, right, so AI-first IDE, and we measure AI, you know, are you using an AI tool, and we look at the Windsurf or other analytics and try to, but you know, there, again, those, for some reason, those products are always telling you that you are super AI-first, for some reason, but if that person is like, okay, so tell me how I need to use AI in your company.\" I was like, well, like, so we realized that we don't have a great top-down master AI workflow, right?\n\n They say, hey, when you receive a spec, this is what we think you should do. You know, this is how we provide context to your work. These are the best prompts that worked out in the last years for us. So I think we should use this and so on and so on. So still, you know, we don't want to tell people exactly, you know, in this, especially in the, you know, in the fast improving field, you don't want to, you know, lock yourself into a master workflow.\n\n So we want to still keep this little light. So my message to the Engineering leads is that let's define a master workflow and let's see people are following that by 80% you know there's always 20% to do better or different things more personalized you know like taste and but let's keep improving our master workflow right so if there is someone in the organization who came up with a great idea how to do X we should you know see if we want to elevate it to a workflow so everything and how do we define the master workflow well we should probably take a look at the best performers across the top 20% engineers and see how they are using it, right?\n\n Everything that I explained, the input to this work is now and later as well, hey, so what are these guys doing with AI? How are they using it? What is their workflow, right? So this is the topic that we thought that, you know, we want the Crossover AI Vision to help us with, right? Because if you can tell me that, hey, here's your team, here's the first guy, this is how he is using AI. And this, hopefully this can go really deep, right?\n\n Like, oh, when he is about to do a bug fix review or, you know, bug fix deep dive, this is what he is doing, this is his prompt, and so on. Oh, but here's a second guy, right? And hopefully it can also tell me that, hey, this guy is not really using far from your master workflow, because we can define a master workflow, right? This other guy is probably seems like doing better, right? This is something you need to look at, right?\n\n There's some innovation going on here, some new ideas. So, yeah, so we always go back to, well, it would be good to know what people are doing all the time, right? And that's why...\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:09:28.787Z)\nYou guys got the idea, right? So that's my thinking around this.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:09:38.812Z)\naround this, but if I really want to simplify the business outcome this quarter, I want to be very clear in Engineering that, hey, we came up with an awesome AI-first workflow. It's, you know, it's IDE workflow. Let's call it an IDE workflow. And we have a very objective way checking if people are using it. And we have a very cool way. To learn about new ideas. So we're always improving our workflow.\n\n So that will be a good outcome because I think this can help the lower performers to do better. This can help new hires to do great quicker. And this can probably improve our performance a lot if we have this. But I don't want to be me and Robert Sit down and just try to get the master workflow because we have a lot of data right and we should be able to gather the data, but the outcome is that now we are more standardized and Always improving always improving our standard way of working Situation where Robert is both customer and worker I love the idea that you're simplifying.\n\n\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:11:10.398Z)\nAt the same time, I would like to say, what is your biggest bottleneck right now in Engineering? Is it specs or is it tickets? You've got two streams of work, right? Or is there a third one that I'm missing?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:11:22.848Z)\nNo, it's specs. It's feature development to me, right? I know that maintenance is now, it's a tier one problem because of Khoros, but that's because of Khoros. We got this big backlog, we're going to remove the backlog and they will go back to...\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:11:41.205Z)\nSo the biggest problem your team is facing is working with specs, yeah? Delivering...\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:11:48.028Z)\nWhy are you stating that like that? I'm not sure if that's the... That's not the problem. We are working on that, but that's not the problem.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:12:00.822Z)\nThe problem is that it's taking too long.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:12:05.045Z)\nI would say that the biggest dollar improvement we can get is the spec delivery, right? That's what we need to do better. If I can pick one thing... How would you measure it?\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:12:18.035Z)\nYou would measure it that before this change, you were doing one mini spec with three engineers, now you can do one mini spec with two engineers in a week. How would you objectively measure this?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:12:30.029Z)\nRight now, in Q2, we delivered 83% our goals. In Q3, we delivered 90%. It's still not 100%. So hopefully, we can deliver more. So we're still under-delivering on our commitments. Now you can blame a bunch of factors, but that doesn't change it.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:12:52.106Z)\nabout goals that also involves TPMs, right? So it might be because TPMs... But if you're talking about... But if you're double the productivity, right?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:13:05.136Z)\nTPMs can't hurt us that much, because we have a budget.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:13:12.182Z)\nOkay, fair enough.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:13:13.903Z)\nSo, but we don't measure, back to your question, we don't really have a good line like daily or weekly product. I don't know, we've been cross or we do the feature ticket per person per day or whatever, per week, right? We measure that as a main productivity thing. That's probably the closest you can get right now, but it's not perfect, but no matter, it's perfect because it's something we define, right?\n\n It's not an external thing.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:13:44.762Z)\nSo- I don't think that's what the metric you want to influence, but there's not a success definition for the process.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:13:55.734Z)\nThe definition is still 360 visibility and ability to test hypothesis.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:14:14.114Z)\nIn terms of I have a master workflow, I know that many people were using it or for that type of work they were using it. Now I increase that and am I happier with the outcome quality or whatnot? Are the leads now more excited about their people? Now somebody we were about to hire now suddenly becomes like an above average performer just because they embrace that. I think it's still observability that a lot of Crossover can do for a central launch.\n\n Obviously wants to go for productivity, right?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:14:44.503Z)\nWell, yeah, but the outcome is also that we will get so much personalized data so we can do better coaching, right? We can improve our, you know, we replaced more than 15% our workforce in Q3. That's a lot, right?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:15:07.795Z)\nHow much?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:15:08.085Z)\n15, Okay.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:15:09.576Z)\nI thought I heard 15. I was like, what?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:15:14.778Z)\nThat used to be the norm, but in the last one year, the norm was less than 15%, right? So I still felt like we replaced a bunch of people. Yeah. I don't know. Newman, did we answer any of your questions?\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:15:28.684Z)\nSo again, I'm trying to focus it down on even on the spec part. When you see your... When we look at the master workflow, is the issue on converting the specs into the design work? Or into separate GitHub stories? Or is the issue once you have a story going into the implementation part of it? Or is it the testing part of it? Or where is the issue? Because I don't want to say, OK, well, here is the master workflow, and we will go and take all of it and fix all of it in one go, right?\n\n\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:16:09.929Z)\nBut when you have a standardized workflow, then you can look at it and go, oh, the decomposition's wrong, or it's inefficient. But when we have lots of people doing things differently, you have different problems at different stages. And that's the problem we've got today.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:16:27.923Z)\nIsn't that more like a mistake?\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:16:29.484Z)\nThe answer, Dilma, to your question is, I think we know the different stages of the work, right? If you want me to pick one stage, right, then the different stages like, oh, you get a spec, you're trying to define what you need to do, then you actually need to do it, then you need to release it, test it and release it, all the stuff. I will always pick doing the work, right? I don't think, you know, that I, you know, I think coding is still the most challenging part and Engineering, I don't think it's anything else.\n\n Now, we might, when we standardize that part, right? And that's where we went, I think, naturally, recently, right? When we said, you know what, what we really want that will help coding or delivering your work is that if you build the right context, this is what the best people are doing, building the right context. We definitely want them to, Now, there's a big difference between randomly talking to your IDE versus having some thought process, right?\n\n And it can be like small things, right? So I got really, really good designing mocked UIs. I'm doing this for a couple of pet project that I have, but also I did one for Engineering stuff this morning. And the reason why they all look very, very good, I think, because I have this trick that I will go to Dribbble.com, I will find something I really like, get a screenshot, and I will give that to the element that I want you to do this, right?\n\n So my UIs don't look like every AI-generated UI out there, right? So that's a workflow element. I know it works very, very well. It helps me to get something production looking quickly in a few shots versus, you know, trying to do something and then, you know, like improve it and then all of a sudden you just, you know, it's just too complicated, right? So that's a part of the workflow. And I think there are hundreds of these things, right?\n\n And we need to educate our people about these things, right? That's the, but if I really wanna give you a focus it's about doing the work, not defining the work or shipping the work, it's like still doing the work. And now, when we think we have a good workflow and we still wanna improve, we'll go after other areas, right? Because I was so, like Robert has this idea that in order to have an AI agent doing a feature work end to end, you just, give it to, you know, like, don't even open an IDE, it's happening in the background.\n\n You need to define probably a subset of your work in a way, in a certain way, so you know that, okay, this is probably, I have the right context everywhere, so I think this can be done, right? It's probably not like, here's my spec, right? So, my point there is, there will be certain inside certain workflow ideas in the designing the work part as well, right? But it sounded like you wanted to figure out which part of the workflow we should focus on.\n\n\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:20:02.450Z)\nYeah, so it's more about the implementation aspect, not the design aspect, not the detailed design, not that. That's not the workflow that you're interested in.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:20:10.996Z)\nAnd you know, at the end of the day, we have much more people implementing than designing, so I guess I spend dollar on implementing.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:20:19.391Z)\nThe way I Read your question is not what phase you want to optimize. Again, your goal is to improve productivity. This product can help improve productivity by enabling accurate observability, because you can't improve what you don't understand.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:20:36.143Z)\nI think observability is a great way of thinking about this. App, right? You want to have great analytics, like, okay, what's going on, right? So, like, okay, this is exactly the opposite of what I want to be going on, right? So, what do I change, right? So, we don't have that observability. You know, we, like, a month ago, we asked everyone, like, hey, can you self-report your workflow, right? And some guys did a really good job, right?\n\n It's like, oh, you that's a good idea. Some guys are like, well, that's pretty, you know, lame, right? So right away we saw like, oh my God, the spread is crazy, right? It's just so big. And I want to decrease the spread for sure, right? It's too random. It's too much dependent on the guy, right?\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:21:36.558Z)\nAnd when we pick observability, I think the next thing, and that's where it connects to what you were saying, Roman, is that You did already break up your work into final phases, finalizing a design, creating a design, implementing something. So the AI Vision should be able to recognize what you're doing that maps to something you define valuable in your team. So then you can start wondering about, hmm, but how did you do it?\n\n Do you do it differently than last week? Do you do it differently for this project versus the other project? Start creating this data also.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:22:08.024Z)\nYeah, so I think, you know, Samy's point, Samy was like, you can already ask very specific questions from your data set, and your data set should be able to answer most of those questions, right? So I don't know if the work for this goal here is a lot of creating a bunch of new feature, right, or capability, or using it very, very well. It doesn't really matter, right? My goal here is not to... I don't want to limit this like, oh, these are the new things we want to build.\n\n Maybe this is just you guys helping us to ask the questions, understand the data. You know what I mean, right?\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:22:57.567Z)\nIt's a full circle. We have a Kanban, we have resources. That means that you don't have to make it your pet side project, but somebody that you allocate on this Kanban can obsess about that. Is our technology able to generally understand the Engineering workflow? Is it accurately describing that? So I think that's the big benefit. We improve the technology and because we're using your team and they are connected, we're also seeing if that's accurate.\n\n You also have a good customer feedback look in terms of completeness, accuracy, and whatnot. So in the end, we still improve our Vision engine. It's just we have the constructs such as what's the work being done and and create full observability of that work, or something like that. I don't go into the solution space. That's what it sounds like,\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:23:38.563Z)\nYeah, a random person in this Kanban will be a little bit different than other Kanbans, right? When you code right here, I think the engineer should be able to do a bunch of prompting and understand the data, putting stuff together, right? I think it's...\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:23:57.407Z)\nThis person will do two things. Improve the Vision pipeline that the output ontology improves in quality or comprehensibility or whatnot. And then the other thing is use it to output the reports that enable business decisions. Both are in the scope. You don't have to pay for that. That's how I see it. And the success factor is that when the quarter ends, you will have a great budget to write up and ideally also results.\n\n But even if observability is there and you don't improve anything, it's still a big win.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:24:28.514Z)\nYeah, I agree with those thoughts.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:24:34.339Z)\nOkay.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:24:35.880Z)\nI like that. And I love the idea that the team implementing that is the team that needs the problem solved. I love that.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:24:44.407Z)\nWe need new manure.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:24:45.368Z)\nThere's a lot of data, right? A video stream of data, right?\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:24:57.859Z)\nSo how many, how many- Robert knows that that's a lot of data.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:25:01.983Z)\nHe's been looking at my phone.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:25:03.583Z)\nHe's been looking at my, just for a single day, I'm like, dude, I can't even get this far, so.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:25:09.548Z)\nRight, and you know, it's like, we have zillions of frames, right? And like, how do we, how do we ask, right? Because it's, I think there's a lot of insights and thinking, and it's probably their own science like, okay, if you can watch everything what I'm doing, how do we actually make sense of it, right? Like, this is, you know, you guys wear whoop, or you know about whoop, right? This thing, right?\n\n It had a sensor, it will just scan, you know, my heart rate or whatnot, and temperature, every millisecond, I don't know, right? So it has a lot of data, but I go to the app, it's like, okay, great, this was your recovery today, right? One thing, right? Oh, your sleep was bad because of this, right? So I think there's a, you know, that's the hard part, right? That, okay, you have all this low level data.\n\n What are the, you know, how do you roll it off?\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:26:18.288Z)\nbut yeah, synthesizing insights. That's always the hard part.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:26:22.929Z)\nYeah.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:26:25.010Z)\nYou guys, did you guys see those memes that, you know, like this caps or t-shirts that, you know, like when people are saying that, oh, I always, you know, when I was young, there's a bunch of versions, but the point is like, oh, when I was young, I always wanted to have a carrier to, look at a bunch of raw data and synthesizing insights and helping businesses. Like you just explained us like, okay, this is the dream job that I have.\n\n I will find the meme, right? It's gonna be better if you see the meme. Anyway, yeah, so yeah, long story short, we wanna have a good analytics of what's going on on and roll it up to great insights that we can use to coach back the organization. And it's like a right-sizing. If you think about the AWS, you're always trying to figure out what's going on. You're right-sizing. Sometimes you're up-sizing.\n\n So you're constantly making change of the environment you are observing to get better performance. So that's what we want to do, constant observability, roll insights and constant change back to the environment so it can get more productive.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:27:48.204Z)\nRobert, we have the Kanban almost fully staffed, which is fine. Two people at this moment probably is more than okay. And are they also available to start working on this on Monday?\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:27:57.328Z)\nThere's also other work going on.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:28:00.869Z)\nI'm always looking for something, right? This time I'm looking to stop it. In this whole conversation. Yeah, I'm looking to stop work to work on this. That's why I founded this company.\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:28:19.032Z)\nSo there's a MySQL upgrade happening this weekend, which unblocks a bunch of performance fixes that we need to roll out soon after. But the other work, oh, the SAS thing is the other major goal.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:28:36.868Z)\nBut that could be quick. That's not going to...\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:28:41.706Z)\nYeah, I mean, the amount of work is easy.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:28:43.587Z)\nWe're going to go into very practical things, so if you want to drop, just have some things that I'm going to clarify for myself. But, yeah. OK. Sorry, Robert. I thought that that's going to have been, that has already been done or something like that. That was my initial understanding from Lumon.\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:28:58.455Z)\nNo, so the work's easy, but there was a time lag. So we couldn't roll out the preferred name changes to the database. Without causing an outage. So we're tacking it on to the maintenance window this weekend.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:29:13.852Z)\nOK. But people can start working on this.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:29:18.774Z)\nWas that Matthias, or?\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:29:22.156Z)\nNo. So we've got Toan and Path to cross over at the moment. We had Matthias, but he resigned with no notice. OK.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:29:32.041Z)\nOh, that's why he hasn't responded. I wish there was a way in Gchat just to say that this person doesn't work here anymore. So I'm not waiting for this person to respond back.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:29:43.627Z)\nAnd that's where Smart Vision, telling you, I think a label or somebody, this person is already talking with you, is already looking for a job.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:29:52.034Z)\nYeah, or maybe we can call it IT Ops. Offboarding people who are not here anymore.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:30:01.341Z)\nYeah.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:30:01.841Z)\nOkay, good.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:30:03.779Z)\nOkay.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:30:06.480Z)\nAll right.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:30:09.380Z)\nBut Robert, back to work for next week. Do we have capacity or no?\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:30:19.202Z)\nYeah, I mean, we can start injecting. I don't have a full person committed to it, but we can certainly start doing some things.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:30:28.964Z)\nWhen can I have... People committed to this Kanban.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:30:34.038Z)\nBut they are committed to this Kanban, they just have other things to do that I guess you should own too, if you own this Kanban, no?\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:30:41.941Z)\nYeah, yeah, that's what I'm asking Robert.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:30:44.082Z)\nNo, that is correct, like I'm telling you where I'm coming from\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:30:48.244Z)\nNo, no, so they're already working on the specs, right? So my question to Robert was, when do they finish that work and we'll have them available to work on the Vision part. That's what I'm trying to get to. They're not putting their thumbs. The question is, when can...\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:31:09.178Z)\nYeah, I mean, so there's a few weeks of work. We can pull off path, I don't know, probably Wednesday or something and have them start doing stuff.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:31:18.881Z)\nAwesome. Cool.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:31:22.061Z)\nThat's for the data migration? I don't know. I'm going to talk my angle. I feel very guilty for a month I was out without creating clarity on what we need to implement. So one month of my budget was lost because of that. Now I want to work on this. But I also understand that the product needs more. I didn't order for that, but I know there are different outcomes that need to happen to keep this product running.\n\n And I'm just trying to get clarity on that. And in an ideal world, in my ideal world of chosen ignorance, there should be no other work other than this. So that's why I'm trying to clarify. I mean sure there is other work though, but Dragos is acting as a customer right now, so Yeah, I know I'm the budget person like two months from now reporting what I spend the count on and trying to like that was my mission, right?\n\n Now migrating to my sequel and whatnot and again, I know this work That's the whole thing, right?\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:32:17.757Z)\nI'm trying to look for the biggest value that there's mandatory thing defense and whatnot and that's that's that so my my simple question what other work streams are in are in flight for the next one or two weeks that that amount of what you're talking about is is what yes there's a mix of things so there's performance improvement because it's been degrading substantially and having an impact on people using it so fixing some of those things we've got about four items backed up around release and a few other still requiring development work um we've got some high priority bugs.\n\n With the latest Mac OS upgrade, the UI is freezing. We need to get that fixed probably within a week max, because that's actively impacting people.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:33:04.222Z)\nYeah, it is. Who is using this, and how much, and how many of those users? Or what do you mean? You're talking about the crossword, or you're talking about this Insights thing no work smart. We're just general. We're smart.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:33:22.990Z)\nOkay, cool You rebuild understand they didn't try to rebuild the whole micro is bush right over over the weekend and we've got What? We've got everything ready to roll out for that as well We just needs to the rollout work, but that'll probably happen, you know in the background of the next month Um Yes, I mean we don't have major secrets, you know, like one guy who we're just working on this Vision thing One and when the third comes let's assign that guy and let's keep one guy throughout the quarter Doing other things that if we don't do it, we look like like fools for not doing that But if that's all we do then we look like fools also, right?\n\n\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:34:12.983Z)\nThat's mine.\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:34:13.424Z)\nYeah, I mean the challenge i've got is I've got Toan and Path. And Toan's good. Path is a bit more junior. And I can put Path on dealing with all the SE7 and the other things, but he's actually going to need support from Toan to be able to do that, probably quite a decent amount of support.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:34:35.421Z)\nBut the SE7 is separate, right, of these two guys?\n\n[Robert Egglestone] (2025-10-24T13:34:40.845Z)\nSo we've got three slots, two for feature, one for SE7. And then I've got two people, and I have to juggle both.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:34:48.259Z)\nOK. So staffing is a bit even in a bit of a harder position. Yeah. I don't know. I understand you guys are struggling with that. There's nothing else I can say, but let's try to make room for that. We can push some things later. Look, I think that this is a problem that requires not only work time, but also calendar time. You change something, you see how it measures next week, you see that it decomposes something, you reprocess that, there's a lot waiting time.\n\n So I would get this thread running as soon as possible, even if that means releasing the Mac OS version three weeks later, or I don't know, something like some of these choices can be made because this will require every week of this quarter in terms of waiting and getting feedback and whatnot.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:35:32.623Z)\nOkay.\n\n[Noumaan Shah] (2025-10-24T13:35:34.164Z)\nYeah, I agree. We might want to do like time interleaving Robert.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:35:44.897Z)\nYeah.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:35:51.801Z)\nHappy weekend. Merry Christmas.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:35:56.824Z)\nIt's Friday morning. I just heard we look like fools anyway, that's what I heard. It's not the weekend yet.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:36:03.148Z)\nI just heard that we look like fools anyway, so.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:36:08.400Z)\nIn this audience, I can speak freely, right? Yes.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:36:12.242Z)\nI think it's a great, it's a great project. And again, going back to the very first thing I said, you know, I really want to take advantage of two very unique things that we have this tracker in general, and then we built a bunch of stuff to, to observe the data. You know, let's, let's, let's take advantage of that.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:36:34.476Z)\nAbsolutely. Yeah.\n\n[Jozsef Czapovics] (2025-10-24T13:36:36.677Z)\nAnd I think this will get closer to that one missing piece that you and I talked about all the time, that when we do an acquisition, we always miss something that the legacy team was doing. And I really want to use AI Vision to understand what everyone is doing all the time. Right. So, and hopefully this will be a good practice. Right. If we can show that, Hey, look, we use AI Vision to understand what the engineer is doing.\n\n All the time and there is all these insights, it's just a small step, small adjustment to check, hey, what is this legacy team is doing all the time? And what are the things that we don't know that they're doing, right? So I think this would be a good prep for that for the next large acquisition. Yep. OK, cool. See you guys.\n\n[Dragos Nuta] (2025-10-24T13:37:27.871Z)\nCheers.\n\n[UNKNOWN_SPEAKER] (2025-10-24T13:37:29.100Z)\nBye-bye."}
