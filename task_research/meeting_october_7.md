## Key Decisions from This Day

All 18 key decisions from October 7 focused on several interconnected themes:

**Primary Focus Areas:**

### 1. Cohort-Based Program Implementation
- **Decision:** Implement 2-3 week cohort-based program for BrainLift Coach adoption
- **Rationale:** Need structured approach to drive quality BrainLift creation and engagement

### 2. Direct Instruction Principles Application (Multiple decisions)
- **Decision:** Apply Direct Instruction principles from learning science experts to BrainLift Coach curriculum
- **Rationale:** Need systematic approach to improve curriculum effectiveness based on established research
- **Note:** This decision was reinforced multiple times throughout the day across different work sessions

### 3. Cognitive Load Theory Implementation (Multiple decisions)
- **Decision:** Apply cognitive load theory principles to structure BrainLift Coach curriculum
- **Rationale:** Need to optimize learning effectiveness by managing cognitive load and element interactivity
- **Note:** This decision was reinforced multiple times throughout the day across different work sessions

### 4. Curriculum Structure Revision
- **Decision:** Restructure curriculum to follow Direct Instruction track-based organization
- **Rationale:** Current structure violates track organization principles leading to 'teach and abandon' problem

### 5. Content Quality Improvement
- **Decision:** Revise DOK4 SPOV statements to address critical flaws identified in quality assessment
- **Rationale:** Quality assessment showed DOK4 SPOV section as 'Flawed', requiring improvement for curriculum effectiveness

## Knowledge & Insights

### BrainLift Coach Course Strategy
**Program Structure:**
- **Duration:** 2-3 week cohort program with daily sessions
- **Cohort Size:** Limited to 10 people per cohort
- **Focus:** Creating 3-5 high-quality BrainLifts per participant
- **Support:** One-on-one coaching access during course
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Manager involvement and stakeholder alignment required

**Program Goals:**
- Drive BrainLift adoption across organization
- Ensure quality content creation
- Build expertise systematically
- Enable collaborative learning

### Direct Instruction Principles for BrainLift Coach

**Core Learning Principles:**
1. **Worked Examples:** Must precede independent practice
2. **Example Quality:** Design quality determines learning effectiveness
3. **Split-Attention Principle:** Requires integrated information presentation
4. **Element Interactivity:** Determines cognitive load impact

**Three Main Components:**
1. **Program Design:**
   - Content analysis
   - Clear communication
   - Instructional formats
   - Skill sequencing
   - Teaching generalizable strategies (not rote memorization)

2. **Organization of Instruction:**
   - Track-based organization solves 'teach and abandon' problem
   - Students grouped by zone of proximal development
   - Flexible grouping (not rigid tracking)
   - Academic learning time as key success predictor

3. **Student-Teacher Interaction:**
   - Scripts specify exact teacher wording and corrections
   - Continuous assessment and feedback
   - Immediate correction and reinforcement

**Five Juxtaposition Principles:**
- Guide clear communication and concept formation
- Each principle addresses a specific source of potential misunderstanding
- Weaknesses in any element cannot be compensated by strengths in others

### DOK3 Insights - Cognitive Architecture & Learning

**Working Memory Constraints:**
- **Capacity:** 4 novel elements maximum
- **Implication:** Novice creators need sequential chunks ≤4 interacting elements to prevent overflow

**Scaffolding Progression:**
- Must follow progression from complete examples to independent creation
- Removing scaffolding too early causes reversion to aimless content generation
- Present variation only after 60% accuracy on similar examples
- Different examples from different domains overwhelm working memory before concept mastery

**Element Interactivity:**
- High element interactivity when learning several components simultaneously
- Determines cognitive load impact on learning effectiveness
- Split-attention effects depend on element interactivity level
- High element interactivity materials already saturate working memory

**Interleaving & Variation:**
- **Timing:** Builds problem-type discrimination after 50% accuracy achieved
- **Condition:** Present variation only after 60% accuracy on similar examples
- **Risk:** Too early variation overwhelms working memory

**Dual-Channel Processing:**
- Increases total cognitive capacity
- Temporal contiguity principle for words and pictures
- Integration removes extraneous cognitive load

### Annotated Examples as Learning Tool

**Function:**
- Establish definition of 'good'
- Provide baseline for comparison
- Direct attention properly
- Eliminate split-attention

**Critical Success Factor:**
- Worked examples' 6x time advantage disappears when annotations teach wrong patterns
- Proper attention direction is essential
- Must eliminate split-attention effects

### Direct Instruction Track Structure Analysis

**Current Curriculum Problem:**
- DOK levels taught as isolated units with no practice between introductions
- Working memory's 4-element capacity + high element interactivity = cognitive overload guaranteed
- 'Teach and abandon' pattern where skills disappear from instruction

**Solution:**
- Need distributed reinforcement across 15+ lessons rather than massed introduction
- Track-based organization maintains continuous reinforcement
- Grouping focuses on specific skill readiness rather than global characteristics

### Split-Attention Effects in Learning

**Core Principle:**
- Effects depend on element interactivity level
- High element interactivity materials already saturate working memory
- Integration removes extraneous cognitive load

**Temporal Contiguity:**
- Words and pictures must be presented together temporally
- Reduces need to hold information in working memory while processing related information

## Action Items & Next Steps

1. **Implement Cohort Program:** Launch 2-3 week pilot with 10 participants
2. **Restructure Curriculum:** Apply track-based organization to prevent 'teach and abandon' problem
3. **Revise DOK4 Content:** Address quality assessment findings on SPOV statements
4. **Apply Cognitive Load Theory:** Review all lessons for element interactivity and working memory constraints
5. **Implement Scaffolding Progression:** Design systematic progression from worked examples to independent creation
6. **Design Annotated Examples:** Create high-quality examples that establish definition of 'good'
7. **Enable Manager Involvement:** Build stakeholder alignment process into cohort program
