## Additional DOK Items Extracted from Meetings

### From Meeting: October 6, 2025

**DOK4 SPOV:**
"Apply Direct Instruction principles from learning science experts to BrainLift Coach curriculum"

**Relevance:** This strategic decision directly addresses the purpose of implementing effective direct instruction components in the course structure, establishing the theoretical foundation for curriculum design.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Working memory has fundamental constraints: capacity limited to 4 elements with 20-second duration. Course structure must be designed around these cognitive load principles to avoid exceeding learners' processing capacity.

**Relevance:** This cognitive architecture constraint is essential for designing effective course structure - it defines hard limits that direct instruction must respect to maximize learning outcomes.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Formative assessment and feedback loops produce learning gains equivalent to doubling the speed of instruction when properly integrated into curriculum structure.

**Relevance:** This insight quantifies the impact of a key direct instruction component (continuous assessment and feedback) on learning outcomes, directly supporting the purpose of maximizing participant learning effectiveness.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Direct Instruction approach comprises four core components: (1) Explicit Teaching - clear, direct instruction on concepts and skills, (2) Structured Progression - carefully sequenced learning experiences, (3) Continuous Assessment - regular checking for understanding, (4) Immediate Feedback - quick correction and reinforcement.

**Relevance:** This summary defines the direct instruction components that must be implemented in the course structure to achieve the stated purpose of maximizing learning outcomes.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Direct Instruction implementation for BrainLift Coach includes track-based organization of curriculum, DOK (Depth of Knowledge) framework for progression, and systematic skill building approach.

**Relevance:** This describes the specific organizational structure for implementing direct instruction in the BrainLift platform, directly addressing how to structure the course effectively.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
BrainLift Coach current quality metrics: 127 weekly experts with 81% pass rate.

**Relevance:** These baseline metrics establish the current state of learning outcomes that the improved course structure and direct instruction aims to enhance.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
Key Direct Instruction principles to apply include: split-attention principle (reduce cognitive load by integrating text with diagrams), worked examples (most effective for building initial schemas), and cognitive load management.

**Relevance:** These are specific direct instruction components that must be incorporated into course design to maximize learning effectiveness.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
AI usage analysis: 75% AI engagement reached, demonstrating high adoption rate for BrainLift Coach platform.

**Relevance:** This metric establishes baseline adoption that course structure improvements aim to build upon, providing benchmark for measuring impact of direct instruction components on participant engagement.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
Research foundation for Direct Instruction includes specific learning science sources: Sweller & Chandler (cognitive load theory), Engelmann & Carnine (Direct Instruction research), Black & Wiliam (formative assessment research), Cowan & Baddeley (working memory research).

**Relevance:** These foundational sources provide theoretical grounding and credibility for the Direct Instruction approach being implemented in course structure, connecting curriculum design decisions to established research.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Formative assessment key elements comprise four integrated components: frequent low-stakes assessments, immediate actionable feedback, continuous adjustment based on student performance, and being built into curriculum structure rather than added on afterward.

**Relevance:** This summary details one of the four core Direct Instruction components (continuous assessment), providing specific implementation guidance for maximizing learning outcomes through systematic feedback integration.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Curriculum implementation action items span five areas: curriculum restructuring applying Direct Instruction principles, assessment integration building formative loops, cognitive load management reviewing all lessons, DOK framework implementation structuring content progression, and metrics tracking monitoring impact on pass rate and engagement.

**Relevance:** These action items provide concrete implementation steps for applying course structure knowledge, translating theoretical Direct Instruction principles into specific development tasks.

### From Meeting: October 7, 2025

**DOK4 SPOV:**
"Restructure curriculum to follow Direct Instruction track-based organization to solve the 'teach and abandon' problem where skills disappear from instruction after initial introduction."

**Relevance:** This strategic decision directly addresses a fundamental flaw in course structure that undermines learning outcomes - the lack of continuous reinforcement is incompatible with effective direct instruction.

---

**DOK4 SPOV:**
"Implement 2-3 week cohort-based program for BrainLift Coach adoption with limited cohort size (10 people), daily sessions, and one-on-one coaching access."

**Relevance:** This defines the specific course structure model for implementing direct instruction at scale, balancing engagement with instructional effectiveness.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Current curriculum creates cognitive overload because DOK levels are taught as isolated units with no practice between introductions. When working memory's 4-element capacity meets high element interactivity in massed presentation, cognitive overload is guaranteed. Solution requires distributed reinforcement across 15+ lessons rather than massed introduction.

**Relevance:** This insight identifies a critical flaw in current course structure and specifies the required fix - distributed practice is essential for effective direct instruction that respects cognitive constraints.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Worked examples provide 6x time advantage over problem-solving for novice learners, but this advantage disappears completely when annotations direct attention to wrong patterns or fail to eliminate split-attention effects.

**Relevance:** This insight reveals that the quality of direct instruction components (specifically worked examples) is as critical as their presence - poorly designed direct instruction can negate its benefits entirely.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Scaffolding must follow specific progression: present complete worked examples first, then gradually remove support, and only introduce variation after learners achieve 60% accuracy on similar examples. Removing scaffolding too early causes reversion to aimless content generation.

**Relevance:** This specifies the precise sequencing required for effective direct instruction scaffolding in the course structure, ensuring learner progression maximizes outcomes.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Direct Instruction has three main organizational components: (1) Program Design - content analysis, clear communication, instructional formats, skill sequencing, teaching generalizable strategies; (2) Organization of Instruction - track-based organization, grouping by zone of proximal development, flexible grouping; (3) Student-Teacher Interaction - scripted wording and corrections, continuous assessment, immediate reinforcement.

**Relevance:** This framework defines the comprehensive structure for implementing direct instruction across all levels of course design, from content to delivery.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Cohort program structure specified as: 2-3 week duration with daily sessions, limited to 10 people per cohort, focus on creating 3-5 high-quality BrainLifts per participant, includes one-on-one coaching access, requires manager involvement and stakeholder alignment.

**Relevance:** This describes the concrete course structure that implements direct instruction principles in a scalable cohort model for the BrainLift platform.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
Element interactivity determines cognitive load impact - high element interactivity occurs when learning several components simultaneously and already saturates working memory capacity.

**Relevance:** This fact defines a key constraint that course structure must respect when designing direct instruction sequences to avoid cognitive overload.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
Present variation and interleaving only after learners achieve 60% accuracy on similar examples; earlier variation overwhelms working memory before concept mastery.

**Relevance:** This provides a specific threshold for course structure decisions about when to introduce complexity in direct instruction sequences.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
Working memory capacity is limited to 4 novel elements maximum, meaning novice creators need sequential chunks of ≤4 interacting elements to prevent cognitive overflow.

**Relevance:** This fact establishes a hard constraint for course structure design - all direct instruction sequences must respect this 4-element limit to prevent overwhelming learners during initial skill acquisition.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
Five Juxtaposition Principles guide clear communication and concept formation in Direct Instruction, with each principle addressing a specific source of potential misunderstanding.

**Relevance:** These principles provide specific design guidelines for creating effective direct instruction materials, ensuring clear communication prevents the most common sources of learner confusion.

---

**DOK1 Fact:**
Academic learning time (time students spend engaged in learning at appropriate difficulty level) is the key success predictor in Direct Instruction implementation.

**Relevance:** This metric identifies what to measure when evaluating whether course structure is effectively implementing direct instruction - engagement at appropriate difficulty is more important than time spent or content covered.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Annotated examples serve four critical functions: (1) establish definition of 'good', (2) provide baseline for comparison, (3) direct attention properly, and (4) eliminate split-attention effects.

**Relevance:** This summary defines the complete purpose of annotated examples in course structure, ensuring that direct instruction materials include all four functions rather than just providing examples without proper guidance.

---

**DOK2 Summary:**
Dual-channel processing principles include three components: (1) using both visual and auditory channels increases total cognitive capacity, (2) temporal contiguity principle requires words and pictures presented together temporally, and (3) proper integration removes extraneous cognitive load.

**Relevance:** This framework specifies how to design direct instruction materials that maximize cognitive capacity by leveraging both processing channels, directly addressing cognitive load management in course structure.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Interleaving and variation must follow specific timing: builds problem-type discrimination only after 50% accuracy is achieved, with variation presented only after 60% accuracy on similar examples. Too-early variation overwhelms working memory before concept mastery.

**Relevance:** This insight provides precise decision rules for when to introduce complexity in direct instruction sequences, preventing premature variation that would undermine learning effectiveness.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Zone of proximal development grouping in Direct Instruction focuses on specific skill readiness rather than global characteristics, using flexible grouping instead of rigid tracking to ensure students work at appropriate difficulty levels.

**Relevance:** This describes the organizational principle for structuring learner groups in the course, ensuring that direct instruction delivery matches each participant's actual readiness level rather than using fixed categories.

---

**DOK3 Insight:**
Temporal contiguity principle requires words and pictures to be presented together temporally because separated presentation forces learners to hold information in working memory while processing related information, creating unnecessary cognitive load.

**Relevance:** This insight explains why synchronous presentation of related information is essential in course materials - asynchronous presentation wastes working memory capacity on retention rather than learning.
