## Key Decisions from This Day

All 17 key decisions from October 6 focused on a central theme:

**Primary Focus:** Apply Direct Instruction principles from learning science experts to BrainLift Coach curriculum

**Rationale:** Need systematic approach to improve curriculum effectiveness based on established research

**Key Decision Areas:**
1. **Cognitive Architecture & Learning Constraints**
   - Apply knowledge of working memory limitations (4 elements, 20 second duration)
   - Design curriculum around cognitive load principles

2. **Direct Instruction Principles**
   - Implement split-attention principle in lesson design
   - Use worked examples effectively
   - Manage cognitive load strategically

3. **Formative Assessment & Feedback**
   - Integrate feedback loops that produce learning gains equivalent to doubling speed
   - Build systematic assessment into curriculum structure

4. **Quality Metrics**
   - Target improvements to 81% pass rate
   - Support 127 weekly experts through improved curriculum design

## Knowledge & Insights

### AI Usage Analysis
- **Achievement:** 75% AI engagement reached
- **Significance:** Demonstrates high adoption rate in current implementation

### Cognitive Architecture & Learning Constraints
**Working Memory Capacity:**
- **Capacity:** 4 elements
- **Duration:** 20 seconds
- **Implication:** Must structure lessons to avoid exceeding these fundamental limits

**Key Principles:**
- Split-attention principle: Reduce cognitive load by integrating text with diagrams
- Worked examples: Most effective for building initial schemas
- Cognitive load management: Essential for effective learning design

### Direct Instruction Approach
**Core Components:**
1. **Explicit Teaching:** Clear, direct instruction on concepts and skills
2. **Structured Progression:** Carefully sequenced learning experiences
3. **Continuous Assessment:** Regular checking for understanding
4. **Immediate Feedback:** Quick correction and reinforcement

**Implementation for BrainLift Coach:**
- Track-based organization of curriculum
- DOK (Depth of Knowledge) framework for progression
- Systematic skill building approach

### Formative Assessment & Feedback Loops
**Impact:** Produces learning gains equivalent to doubling the speed of instruction

**Key Elements:**
- Frequent, low-stakes assessments
- Immediate, actionable feedback
- Continuous adjustment based on student performance
- Built into curriculum structure, not added on

### BrainLift Coach Quality Metrics (Current State)
- **Weekly Experts:** 127 active participants
- **Pass Rate:** 81%
- **Opportunity:** Improve curriculum effectiveness to increase pass rate and support more experts

### Research Foundation
**Learning Science Sources:**
- Cognitive load theory (Sweller, Chandler)
- Direct Instruction research (Engelmann, Carnine)
- Formative assessment research (Black & Wiliam)
- Working memory research (Cowan, Baddeley)

## Action Items & Next Steps

1. **Curriculum Restructuring:** Apply Direct Instruction principles to course design
2. **Assessment Integration:** Build in formative assessment loops
3. **Cognitive Load Management:** Review all lessons for cognitive load optimization
4. **DOK Framework Implementation:** Structure content progression using DOK levels
5. **Metrics Tracking:** Monitor impact on pass rate and expert engagement
