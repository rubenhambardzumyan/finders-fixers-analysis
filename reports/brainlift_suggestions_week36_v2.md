# BrainLifts To Focus on Next

I've analyzed your weekly WorkSmart data and found the following problems to focus on next. Build BrainLifts to accommodate the solution process and organize knowledge as you're building your expertise.

## AI Tool Orchestration for Development Productivity

**Why this BrainLift:** Your data shows 20+ hours using AI tools with a critical discovery - "workflow-Claude-VS Code" orchestration achieved 90% success vs 40% for direct usage, representing 3x productivity gains that could transform team velocity and reduce debugging time from 4 hours to 1 hour.

**Draft purpose statement:** This BrainLift solves the 60% failure rate in AI-assisted development by creating systematic orchestration patterns that enable engineers to evolve from code creators to high-leverage reviewers, specifically scoped to Claude-VS Code-Chrome DevTools workflows.

## User Retention Crisis Management

**Why this BrainLift:** From 141 BrainLift Coach users, only "tens" remain active despite 85% satisfaction rate, risking product viability; your insight that "terminology optimization drives engagement more than visual optimization" could unlock 60% retention rate improvements.

**Draft purpose statement:** This BrainLift addresses the 70% user churn crisis by implementing behavioral psychology principles and engagement mechanics specifically for knowledge management tools, targeting 100+ weekly active users within one quarter.

## Educational Assessment Standardization

**Why this BrainLift:** Assessment template inconsistencies across roles cause 30% longer hiring cycles and unreliable evaluations; your insight that "most assignments are domain knowledge + build a BrainLift" enables complete unification of the assessment framework.

**Draft purpose statement:** This BrainLift eliminates assessment quality variance by creating a 4-6 lesson standardized curriculum that reduces candidate preparation from days to hours while maintaining role-specific relevance in BrainLift creation evaluation.
