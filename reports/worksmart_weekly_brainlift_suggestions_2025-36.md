# BrainLifts To Focus on Next

I've analyzed your weekly WorkSmart data and found the following problems to focus on next. Build BrainLifts to accommodate the solution process and organize knowledge as you're building your expertise.

## BrainLift 1 - AI Tool Orchestration for Development Workflows

**Why this BrainLift:** Your WorkSmart data shows you spent 20+ hours using AI tools with a discovered 90% success rate using "workflow-Claude-VS Code" orchestration versus 40% for direct usage, revealing a critical knowledge gap in optimal AI tool integration patterns. Solving this will directly impact development velocity metrics by 2-3x based on your morning productivity patterns and enable systematic team-wide adoption of proven orchestration methodologies. Focus on workflow patterns, context preservation strategies, and tool selection frameworks while excluding general AI capabilities or theoretical AI concepts.

**Draft purpose statement:** Develop expertise in orchestrating multiple AI tools sequentially with context preservation to achieve 90%+ task completion rates, enabling 3x productivity gains in complex development workflows by establishing systematic patterns for tool selection, context transfer, and extended conversational strategies that transform rapid-fire queries into high-leverage problem-solving sessions.

## BrainLift 2 - User Engagement Psychology for Technical Products  

**Why this BrainLift:** Your data reveals intense focus on re-engaging 141 existing users with only 54 active (38% engagement), alongside discovery that "terminology optimization drives engagement more than visual optimization" after users abandoned confusing interfaces within 30 seconds. Mastering engagement psychology will directly impact user retention metrics (targeting 70%+ activation) and reduce churn by applying behavioral psychology principles to technical product design. Include Fogg Behavior Model applications, UI psychology, and behavioral triggers while excluding general marketing theory or aesthetic design principles.

**Draft purpose statement:** Build expertise in applying behavioral psychology principles to technical product interfaces to achieve 70%+ user activation rates by mastering terminology optimization, engagement mechanics, and behavioral trigger design that converts confused users into engaged power users within their first 30 seconds of interaction.

## BrainLift 3 - Chrome Extension Architecture for Analytics-Heavy Applications

**Why this BrainLift:** Your WorkSmart shows 4+ hours debugging Manifest V3 violations and PostHog event tracking failures in service workers, with Chrome Web Store rejections blocking distribution while 648 analysis sessions indicate high usage demand. Solving these architectural challenges will unblock product distribution to thousands of potential users and establish reliable analytics infrastructure critical for product decisions. Focus on Manifest V3 compliance patterns, service worker analytics initialization, and event tracking reliability while excluding general Chrome extension development or UI components.

**Draft purpose statement:** Master Chrome extension architecture patterns for analytics-heavy applications to achieve 95%+ event capture reliability and Chrome Web Store compliance, enabling distribution to thousands of users by establishing bulletproof service worker initialization, Manifest V3 compliance strategies, and analytics event tracking patterns that survive worker lifecycle challenges.
