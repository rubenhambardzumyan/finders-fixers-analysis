**Scope:** AI-assisted technical development, conversation design patterns, productivity optimization for software engineering tasks.

### Initial Knowledge Areas
1. **Extended Conversation Architecture**
   - Session design patterns for 45-60 minute collaborative sessions
   - Context retention strategies across tool switches
   - Iterative refinement techniques

2. **Temporal Optimization**
   - Morning cognitive load advantages (5-9 AM peak performance)
   - AI collaboration scheduling for maximum effectiveness
   - Energy management in AI-assisted work

3. **Tool Selection Strategy**
   - Claude Code for complex technical problems
   - Specialized AI tools for domain-specific tasks (PostHog Max AI, Windsurf)
   - Decision frameworks for tool switching

4. **Prompt Engineering Evolution**
   - Context-rich prompt development

2. *"AI collaboration effectiveness peaks during morning cognitive peak hours (5-9 AM) when humans have maximum mental bandwidth for complex problem decomposition and solution synthesis."*

3. *"The most effective AI-assisted development requires treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than a tool - this means conversation design, not just prompt engineering."*

**Initial DOK3 Insights to Explore:**
- Morning sessions show 3x higher complex problem resolution rates
- Context retention across 45+ minute sessions enables deeper technical analysis
- Iterative prompt refinement produces better outcomes than single-shot queries

   - *Agree/Disagree:* Agree on practical focus; filter for quality solutions

### Initial Stance Development
**SPOV Candidates:**
1. *"Service worker architecture in Manifest v3 requires treating analytics as ephemeral by default - design for event loss, not event guarantee."*

2. *"Chrome Web Store approval success depends on over-compliance rather than minimum compliance - exceed requirements to avoid rejection loops."*

3. *"Modern Chrome extensions must be designed with service worker reloads as a feature, not a bug - architecture should assume frequent restarts."*

**Initial DOK3 Insights to Explore:**
- Service worker reloads cause 80% of analytics tracking failures
- Chrome Web Store review process penalizes iterative compliance approaches
- PostHog integration requires global scope initialization to maintain persistence

   - *Main Views:* Customer communication, product feedback loops
   - *Why Follow:* Practical experience in customer feedback systems at scale
   - *Agree/Disagree:* Agree on practical focus; may have different views on feedback frequency

### Initial Stance Development
**SPOV Candidates:**
1. *"Direct feedback mechanisms (thumbs up/down) generate 3x more responses than open-ended questions because they respect cognitive load limitations."*

2. *"Feedback collection timing matters more than feedback collection method - ask during natural stopping points, not during task completion."*

3. *"Behavioral analytics should validate declared feedback, not replace it - users lie to be helpful, but their actions reveal true preferences."*

**Initial DOK3 Insights to Explore:**
- Email feedback collection has 5x lower response rates than in-app feedback
- User feedback quality correlates inversely with feedback request frequency
- Thumbs up/down feedback provides actionable insights when combined with behavioral data
