Meeting Title: Quarterly Planning - Customer Retention Analysis

Jennifer Park: We need to address the customer churn rates we've been seeing this quarter. The data shows some concerning patterns.

Alex Thompson: The exit surveys indicate customers are leaving due to lack of proper onboarding and ongoing support guidance.

Maria Gonzalez: I've been analyzing the customer journey and there are definitely gaps in our retention strategy.

Jennifer Park: We need someone to create a comprehensive customer retention BrainLift. Either Alex, Maria, or Lisa needs to build this - they all have the customer insights we need.

Alex Thompson: I have the survey data and customer feedback analysis.

Maria Gonzalez: I've mapped the customer journey touchpoints and identified the friction points.

Lisa Chang: And I have the retention metrics and success patterns from our best-performing segments.

Jennifer Park: Great, so between the three of you, we should be able to create something comprehensive that addresses the full customer lifecycle.
