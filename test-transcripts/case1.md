Meeting Title: Weekly Team Sync - Knowledge Management

Ruben Hambardzumyan: Hey Eugene! Thanks for joining today's sync. I wanted to discuss something that's been on my mind about our client onboarding process.

Eugene Dolgov: Sure, what's going on with onboarding?

Ruben Hambardzumyan: Well, I've noticed that different team members are explaining our processes differently to new clients. Some focus on the technical aspects, others on the business side, and there's no consistency. It's causing confusion and making us look unprofessional.

Eugene Dolgov: Yeah, I've seen that too. Sarah's approach is completely different from Mike's, and clients have mentioned the inconsistency.

Ruben Hambardzumyan: Exactly. Since you've handled the most successful client onboardings recently and have the best track record with client satisfaction, Eugene, you should build a BrainLift on standardized client onboarding procedures. We need a comprehensive guide that everyone can follow.

Eugene Dolgov: That makes total sense. I can include the step-by-step process, key talking points, common questions and answers, and maybe some templates for the different stages.

Ruben Hambardzumyan: Perfect! That would really help us maintain quality and ensure every client gets the same excellent experience. When do you think you could have something ready?

Eugene Dolgov: I'll start working on it this week. Should have a draft ready by Friday for your review.

Ruben Hambardzumyan: Excellent. This should make a big difference in how we present ourselves to new clients.
