Meeting Title: Product Strategy Discussion - API Documentation

Marcus Chen: Thanks everyone for joining. We've been having some challenges with our API documentation lately. Development teams are constantly asking the same questions about integration procedures.

Sarah Williams: I've noticed that too. The current documentation is scattered across different platforms and there's no single source of truth.

David Rodriguez: The backend team has been spending way too much time answering basic integration questions that should be documented clearly.

Marcus Chen: You should build a BrainLift for comprehensive API integration guidelines. The documentation needs to be centralized and cover all the common use cases and troubleshooting scenarios.

Sarah Williams: That would definitely help reduce the support tickets we're getting.

David Rodriguez: Absolutely. Having a standardized reference would save everyone time.

Marcus Chen: Perfect. Let's target having this ready by next month so we can roll it out to all the development teams.
