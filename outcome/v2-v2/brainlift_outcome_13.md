### Feedback

Your BrainLift has internal domain knowledge but lacks a comprehensive experts section to position your insights within competing schools of thought.

### Coaching

Research external schools of thought in social media management: **Integration-First School** (unified platforms like Khoros), **Best-of-Breed School** (specialized tools per function), **AI-First School** (automation over human workflows). Include experts from competitors (Hootsuite, Sprout Social, Buffer), industry analysts (Forrester, Gartner), and platform strategists with their philosophies on social media management evolution and customer engagement strategies.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your Khoros One analysis addresses platform challenges but doesn't question fundamental assumptions about social media management, customer engagement strategies, and platform consolidation approaches.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That unified platforms are superior to specialized tools (what if integration overhead negates benefits?), 2) That AI-powered publishing is inevitable evolution (what if human authenticity becomes more valuable?), 3) That social customer service improves brand relationships (what if it creates expectation escalation?). Question whether platform fragmentation penalization is customer value or vendor lock-in, and if bot economy monetization serves customers or just Khoros.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The BrainLift incorporates cross-domain insights from multi-channel customer service, enterprise software integration patterns, and consumption-based pricing models from other industries.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Extremely comprehensive Knowledge Tree with detailed DOK1-DOK2 sections covering customer segments, use cases, business models, architecture, operations, algorithms, data models, compliance, and costs.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including positions on AI-powered publishing as cost of entry, AI-human workflow orchestration, and pricing strategies that penalize platform fragmentation.
