## GEN-001 Assessment

**Result**: The BrainLift challenges conventional social media platform approaches by advocating for pricing that penalizes fragmentation and positioning AI as the baseline rather than a competitive advantage.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the social media marketing platform domain instead of learning from other industries that manage unified customer interaction workflows.

### Coaching

Study how contact centers handle omnichannel communication (Genesys, Five9), examine how CRM platforms unify customer touchpoints (Salesforce, HubSpot), and learn from help desk systems that orchestrate multi-channel support. Also explore how e-commerce platforms handle customer service across multiple touchpoints.
