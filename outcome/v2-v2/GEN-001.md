## Summary Analysis

**Mixed Performance**: GEN-001 shows moderate results with 10 out of 15 analyzable BrainLifts passing (67% success rate). 5 BrainLifts failed this assessment, with 1 being unanalyzable due to missing content.

**Key Success Patterns**:
- **Direct Challenge to Orthodoxy**: Successful BrainLifts explicitly questioned fundamental domain assumptions that practitioners "know" but rarely examine
- **Controversial Positioning**: Winners took positions that would provoke disagreement among domain experts
- **Systematic Questioning**: The best performers systematically challenged multiple related assumptions rather than single practices
- **Paradigm Shift Advocacy**: Top BrainLifts advocated for fundamentally different approaches, not just incremental improvements

**Failure Points**:
- **Conventional Wisdom Acceptance**: Failed BrainLifts presented widely accepted best practices without challenging underlying assumptions
- **Operational Focus**: Failures focused on tactical improvements rather than questioning fundamental approaches
- **Risk Aversion**: Some BrainLifts avoided controversial positions that would challenge professional comfort zones
- **Surface-Level Analysis**: Failed cases didn't dig deep enough to identify and challenge core domain assumptions

**Best Practice Examples**:
- **RCA BrainLift**: Systematically questioned every aspect of traditional incident analysis methodology
- **Crossover Hire**: Challenged fundamental recruiting assumptions from geography to assessment methods
- **Import/Integration**: Took aggressive positions that contradict conventional M&A wisdom

**Overall Assessment**: The GEN-001 finder effectively identifies BrainLifts that accept conventional wisdom without challenge. The moderate success rate indicates that challenging orthodoxy is difficult - many authors default to safe, agreeable positions rather than controversial stances. The failures suggest that creating genuinely challenging content requires courage to take positions that would make domain experts uncomfortable, moving beyond operational improvements to fundamental assumption questioning.
