## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift challenges conventional platform migration approaches by advocating for forced customer transitions despite potential churn, questioning the industry norm of accommodating legacy system preferences indefinitely.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the enterprise community platform domain instead of learning from other industries that manage public-facing, high-traffic customer interaction systems.

### Coaching

Study how social media platforms handle content moderation at scale (Twitter/X, Facebook), examine how e-commerce sites manage public product reviews and customer support, and learn from news media comment systems. Also explore how customer support chatbot platforms handle public-facing interactions.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Solid knowledge foundation with clear DOK structure covering customer requirements, technical architecture, customization approaches, and migration challenges.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - understanding Khoros Communities product and Central TPM approach with customer-focused perspective.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is focused on product understanding with clear customer orientation and appropriate scope boundaries. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose covers product understanding and TPM approach but misses critical strategic and competitive decision areas for public-facing community platforms.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Customer migration timing and risk management - balancing forced upgrades against churn risks, (2) Customization vs. standardization trade-offs - supporting customer branding needs while maintaining operational efficiency, and (3) Public-facing reliability standards - acceptable downtime levels for customer-facing vs. internal systems.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs covering Aurora migration completion, legacy interface removal, containerization strategy, product integration, and AI-driven content moderation.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

You have strong technical and product integration stances but missing positions on equally critical customer experience and business strategy areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Community engagement philosophy - hands-off member-driven vs. actively managed community experiences, (2) Brand control boundaries - level of customization to allow without compromising platform integrity, and (3) Growth strategy - focusing on existing customer expansion vs. new customer acquisition in the community platform market.
