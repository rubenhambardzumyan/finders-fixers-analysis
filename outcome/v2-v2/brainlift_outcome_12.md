## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (customer-focused not technical, covers technical solutions only where important) and variables to optimize (product understanding, TPM approach effectiveness).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks clear measurable outcomes and doesn't specify specific use cases or success metrics for the Khoros Communities knowledge.

### Coaching

Define success metrics: improved TPM decision-making speed, reduced customer churn during Aurora migration, specific migration completion targets. Specify use cases: Aurora migration planning, customer retention strategies, technical debt prioritization. Clear outcomes make the BrainLift's practical value for TPM work measurable and actionable.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift has internal team expertise but lacks external experts to position your insights within competing schools of thought about community platforms.

### Coaching

Research external schools of thought in community platform management: **Migration-First School** (prioritizing platform upgrades), **Stability-First School** (maintaining legacy systems longer), **Integration-First School** (unified customer journey approaches). Include external experts from Discourse, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and community platform consultants with their philosophies on platform transitions and customer retention strategies.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your Khoros analysis addresses platform challenges but doesn't question fundamental assumptions about community platform design, user engagement, and migration strategies.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That forced migrations improve customer experience (what if gradual evolution is less disruptive?), 2) That unified platforms are superior to specialized tools (what if best-of-breed integration works better?), 3) That public-facing communities require different architecture than internal ones (what if the distinction is artificial?). Question whether Aurora's benefits justify migration risks or if legacy platform optimization might be more valuable.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Well-structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive DOK1-DOK2 sections covering product functionality, customer value, Aurora migration, and security considerations.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including positions on Aurora migration completion despite customer churn risks, legacy UI removal, and LLM-based content moderation approaches.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The BrainLift incorporates cross-domain insights from public-facing platform management, comparing internal enterprise software patterns with consumer-facing community requirements and architectural differences.
