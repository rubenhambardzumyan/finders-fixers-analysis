**Total Assessments**: 8  
**Passed**: 7 | **Failed**: 1

---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - establishing core principles for designing, deploying, and operating relational databases to meet target SLOs for performance and reliability.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (bounded to initial schema design, indexing strategy, and core operational monitoring) and variables to maximize (performance and reliability SLOs).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates measurable outcomes (meeting target SLOs for performance and reliability) and specifies scope for production relational database systems.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section with 5 relevant database experts including Martin Kleppmann, Andy Pavlo, Markus Winand, Gwen Shapira, and Joe Celko, with detailed credentials and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The BrainLift challenges conventional database practices through SPOVs like avoiding preemptive indexing, not duplicating information, and calculating derived data on the fly.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your database principles focus on traditional relational theory without incorporating insights from other domains that handle similar reliability and performance challenges.

### Coaching

Study approaches from distributed systems, manufacturing, and financial trading: 1) Circuit breaker patterns from microservices architecture for database failover strategies, 2) Manufacturing quality control principles for data validation pipelines, 3) Financial trading systems' approach to low-latency optimization for query performance. These domains have solved similar problems of maintaining performance under load with different architectural patterns.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Well-structured Knowledge Tree with DOK1-DOK2 sections covering SLO definition, schema design, indexing, and query performance.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including contrarian positions on preemptive indexing, data duplication, and join optimization practices.
