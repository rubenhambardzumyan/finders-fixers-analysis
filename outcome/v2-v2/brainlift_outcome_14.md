---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - developing expertise in designing and implementing fast, structured, R2-aligned feedback collection from hiring managers to improve overall hire quality.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (R2-aligned feedback, structured collection) and variables to optimize (identifying missing R2 criteria, diagnosing gaps in hiring process).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates clear measurable outcomes (improve overall hire quality, identify missing R2 criteria) and specifies scope for hiring manager feedback collection systems.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section with 4 relevant recruiting and HR technology experts including Hung Lee, Josh Bersin, Liz Ryan, and Kevin Wheeler, with detailed credentials and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your feedback collection framework addresses tactical challenges but doesn't question fundamental assumptions about hiring manager judgment, automated selection systems, and the relationship between feedback and hiring quality.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That hiring manager feedback is inherently accurate (what if their biases are the problem, not the candidates?), 2) That R2 alignment is the goal (what if rigid specs miss exceptional candidates who don't fit boxes?), 3) That automated systems plus feedback loops lead to better hires (what if human intuition in hiring cannot be systematized?). Question whether "self-learning, self-correcting systems" in hiring are solving the right problem or automating bias at scale.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your hiring feedback insights focus on recruiting practices without exploring how other domains handle expert feedback collection and quality improvement loops in high-stakes decision-making.

### Coaching

Study approaches from medical diagnosis, financial underwriting, and academic peer review: 1) Medical case review processes for learning from diagnostic errors, 2) Financial underwriting feedback loops for credit decision improvement, 3) Academic peer review calibration for maintaining evaluation standards. These domains have solved similar challenges of collecting expert feedback to improve selection systems while managing bias and maintaining decision quality.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Well-structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive sections covering coaching hiring managers, designing AI-led feedback systems, and translating feedback into process improvements.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including positions on self-learning systems, pressure-testing R2 criteria, and the educational role of feedback collection in managing hiring manager expectations.
