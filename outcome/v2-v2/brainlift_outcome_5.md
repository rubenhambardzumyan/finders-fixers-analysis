## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift has minimal expert coverage with only 1 expert (the owner), missing representation from different approaches to AWS cost optimization and key management.

### Coaching

**School of Thought 1: Automation-First Optimization**
- **Expert**: Corey Quinn (@QuinnyPig) - Chief Cloud Economist at The Duckbill Group
- **Main Views**: AWS cost optimization should be heavily automated with continuous monitoring and alerting systems
- **Where to Find**: @QuinnyPig on Twitter

**School of Thought 2: Policy-Driven Cost Control**  
- **Expert**: Andreas Wittig (@andreaswittig) - AWS consultant and author of "Amazon Web Services in Action"
- **Main Views**: Cost optimization should focus on preventive policies and governance rather than reactive cleanup
- **Where to Find**: @andreaswittig on Twitter

**School of Thought 3: FinOps Integration**
- **Expert**: J.R. Storment (@jrstorment) - Co-founder of FinOps Foundation
- **Main Views**: Cloud cost optimization requires cross-functional collaboration between finance, engineering, and operations
- **Where to Find**: @jrstorment on Twitter

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift accepts conventional AWS cost optimization approaches without challenging widely accepted practices in cloud cost management.

### Coaching

Challenge assumptions like "unused resources should be deleted immediately" - explore graduated cost reduction strategies, question whether AWS billing models are optimal for your usage patterns, and examine why organizations accept cloud vendor pricing without negotiation strategies.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the AWS ecosystem instead of learning from other cloud providers and cost optimization approaches.

### Coaching

Study how Google Cloud approaches key management pricing, examine Microsoft Azure's cost optimization tools, and learn from on-premises security key management systems. Also explore how other industries handle asset lifecycle management and unused resource identification.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your knowledge foundation is quite limited with minimal DOK1 facts and insufficient coverage of KMS cost optimization strategies.

### Coaching

Expand your Knowledge Tree with comprehensive coverage of: (1) KMS pricing models and cost drivers beyond key storage, (2) Alternative key management approaches and their cost implications, (3) Automated monitoring and alerting strategies, and (4) Integration patterns with other AWS services that affect KMS costs.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - guiding cost optimization of AWS Key Management Service with explicit scope boundaries.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is narrowly focused on KMS cost optimization with clear scope boundaries. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose focuses on identifying unused keys but misses critical decision areas around cost optimization strategy and risk management.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Risk tolerance levels - how to balance cost savings against data recovery risks, (2) Automation boundaries - when to automate key deletion vs. requiring manual approval, and (3) Cross-account and cross-service impact assessment before key modifications.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear SPOV exists about the hidden cost impact of unused keys accumulating over time.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

You have one cost-awareness stance but missing positions on equally critical risk management and operational decision areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Risk-cost trade-offs - acceptable data recovery risk levels for cost savings, (2) Automation philosophy - level of human oversight required for destructive cost optimization actions, and (3) Vendor relationship - whether to accept AWS pricing models or actively negotiate enterprise discounts.
