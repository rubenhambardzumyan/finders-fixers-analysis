**Analysis Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Total Assessments**: 8  
**Passed**: 6 | **Failed**: 2

---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - current RCA process is painful, time-consuming, and misses real issues, with engineers spending hours on ineffective analysis.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (SaaS product failures, customer-impacting incidents) and variables to maximize (RCA quality, action item completion) while minimizing time to completion.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Clear measurable outcomes specified (time reduction from days to hours, action item completion from 30% to 70%, 50% reduction in repeat incidents) with defined scope for SaaS engineers and TPMs.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section with 8 relevant experts in resilience engineering and incident analysis, including clear descriptions, relevance, and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your RCA framework challenges some assumptions but doesn't question fundamental beliefs about distributed systems incident analysis and organizational learning from failures.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That post-incident analysis is more valuable than real-time learning (what if continuous observation beats retrospective documentation?), 2) That blameless culture means avoiding individual accountability (what if psychological safety requires clear responsibility boundaries?), 3) That complex systems require complex analysis (what if simpler forcing functions prevent more incidents?). Question whether "lessons learned" documents actually transfer knowledge or just create compliance theater.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your RCA insights focus on software engineering practices without exploring how other high-reliability domains handle failure analysis and organizational learning.

### Coaching

Import frameworks from aviation, healthcare, and manufacturing safety: 1) Aviation's Crew Resource Management for better incident communication, 2) Healthcare's M&M conferences for systematic learning culture, 3) Manufacturing's poka-yoke (error-proofing) principles for preventing operator errors. These domains have solved human factors in high-stakes environments where software engineering still struggles with blame vs. learning balance.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Well-structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive DOK1-DOK4 sections covering mental models, investigation patterns, and methodologies for distributed systems.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including contrarian positions on "root cause" terminology, human error attribution, and the value of real-time vs. post-incident analysis.
