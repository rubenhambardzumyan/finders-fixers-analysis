**Passed**: 7 | **Failed**: 2

---

## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Comprehensive experts section with 8 domain experts including Dr. Richard Cook, John Allspaw, Sidney Dekker, and others. All experts have clear credentials, contact information, and relevance to RCA/resilience engineering.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift explicitly challenges fundamental assumptions in RCA practice, including the term "root cause analysis" itself, the role of human error, and traditional linear thinking approaches to complex system failures.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Incorporates external knowledge from resilience engineering, systems safety theory (Swiss Cheese Model, STAMP), aerospace safety models, and academic research from multiple disciplines beyond traditional IT.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong knowledge foundation with comprehensive DOK structure, detailed investigation patterns, methodologies, mental models, and concrete implementation frameworks.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - transforming RCA process from time-consuming, ineffective documentation to valuable system learning that prevents repeat incidents.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is well-focused with clear objectives, success metrics, and scope boundaries. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose focuses on RCA quality and automation but misses critical organizational and cultural decision areas that determine RCA program success.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Incident severity thresholds - when to trigger full RCA vs. lightweight analysis, (2) Cross-team accountability - how to ensure action items get resourced and completed across organizational boundaries, and (3) Knowledge sharing protocols - how to convert RCA insights into training and preventive measures.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs covering fundamental RCA philosophy, blame-free culture, detection prioritization, future-focused analysis, and automation approaches.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

You have strong technical and process stances but missing positions on equally critical organizational and cultural transformation areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Management accountability - should executives be required to act on RCA findings or face consequences, (2) Resource allocation - what percentage of engineering time should be dedicated to addressing RCA action items, and (3) Learning culture - how to handle teams that resist blameless analysis or continue blame-focused thinking.
