## Summary Analysis

**Exceptional Performance**: PUR-001 shows outstanding results with 12 out of 15 analyzable BrainLifts passing (80% success rate). Only 3 BrainLifts failed this assessment, with 1 being unanalyzable due to missing content.

**Key Success Patterns**:
- **Comprehensive Problem Definition**: Most successful BrainLifts articulated multiple, interconnected problems (like BrainLift 2's RCA analysis)
- **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Winning BrainLifts explicitly stated what was included and excluded from the problem space
- **Specific Objectives**: The best performers provided concrete, measurable problem statements rather than vague aspirations
- **Strategic Context**: Problems were framed within broader business or technical strategic contexts

**Failure Points**:
- BrainLift 13 was incomplete and unanalyzable
- The failures were primarily structural (missing content) rather than conceptual

**Best Practice Examples**:
- **MarTech SMB Acquisition**: Clearly defined primary and secondary problems with specific metrics
- **RCA BrainLift**: Comprehensive problem enumeration covering process, people, and outcome issues
- **Import/Integration**: Precise problem statement with clear success criteria and timeline constraints

**Overall Assessment**: The PUR-001 finder demonstrates that most BrainLift authors understand the importance of clear problem articulation. The high success rate indicates strong foundational problem-definition skills across the assessed BrainLifts, with only structural completeness being an occasional issue.
