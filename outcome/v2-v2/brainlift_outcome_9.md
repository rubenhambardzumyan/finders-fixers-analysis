## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your Jive analysis addresses product challenges but doesn't question fundamental assumptions about employee engagement platforms and organizational communication patterns.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That centralized platforms improve communication (what if distributed, context-aware tools work better?), 2) That engagement metrics correlate with productivity (what if they measure activity, not value?), 3) That forced upgrades improve security (what if they disrupt workflows more than vulnerabilities harm?). Question whether "employee engagement platforms" are solving real problems or creating dependency on artificial community-building tools.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your Jive insights focus on enterprise software practices without exploring how other domains handle community building, knowledge management, and user adoption challenges.

### Coaching

Study approaches from social media platforms, academic communities, and city planning: 1) Social networks' organic community formation vs. corporate-mandated engagement, 2) Academic platforms' peer review and knowledge curation systems, 3) Urban planning's public space design for natural social interaction. These domains have solved similar challenges of fostering genuine community and knowledge sharing without forced participation.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Extremely comprehensive Knowledge Tree with detailed DOK1-DOK2 sections covering Unity strategy, customers, users, use cases, technical architecture, data structures, and operational requirements.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including positions on forced customer upgrades, technical debt urgency, generative AI adoption, and mobile-first web UI approaches.
