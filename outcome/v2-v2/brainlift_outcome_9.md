## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift challenges conventional customer relationship approaches by advocating for forced upgrades despite customer resistance, questioning the industry norm of accommodating legacy system preferences.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the enterprise collaboration software domain instead of learning from other industries that have successfully managed similar customer resistance and platform migrations.

### Coaching

Study how telecommunications companies handle forced network upgrades (3G to 4G shutdowns), how operating system providers manage version deprecation (Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS), and how financial services enforce security compliance. Learn from gaming platforms that successfully migrate user bases between versions.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your knowledge foundation is incomplete - while you have good DOK3 insights and DOK4 SPOVs, the Knowledge Tree section is missing, leaving your strategic insights without proper factual support.

### Coaching

Create a comprehensive Knowledge Tree with: (1) Jive product features and capabilities with user adoption metrics, (2) Customer segmentation and usage patterns with specific data, (3) Technical architecture and integration points with performance benchmarks, and (4) Competitive landscape analysis with feature comparisons and market positioning.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - describing the Jive employee engagement platform, customer problems it solves, and solution approaches.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is focused on customer and user perspective with clear scope boundaries excluding technical details and customer-specific implementations. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose covers product description and customer usage but misses critical strategic and competitive decision areas for enterprise software management.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Customer retention vs. modernization trade-offs - when to accommodate legacy preferences vs. force platform evolution, (2) Feature development prioritization - balancing customer requests against technical debt reduction, and (3) Market positioning strategy - competing on stability vs. innovation in the enterprise collaboration space.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs covering forced customer upgrades, technical debt prioritization, AI adoption strategy, and mobile-responsive design approaches.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

You have strong technical and customer management stances but missing positions on equally critical business strategy and competitive positioning areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Customer acquisition strategy - focusing on new customers vs. extracting more value from existing base, (2) Feature development philosophy - innovation vs. maintenance resource allocation, and (3) Market category positioning - whether to compete as collaboration platform vs. employee engagement vs. knowledge management solution.
