## BrainLift 3 - Web Extension Development

**Status**: ❌ FAILED  
**Result**: The purpose mentions "BrainLift-aligned projects" but doesn't specify what constraints, background context, or variables are important for the target users. It's unclear who the specific users are, what their setup constraints might be, or what should be optimized vs. ignored.

### Feedback
Enhance the purpose statement by adding target users (specify if this is for senior developers, teams new to extensions, or specific company contexts), constraints (define technical constraints like browser support requirements, performance targets, team size), variables to optimize (specify what matters most - development speed, maintenance ease, security, performance), and variables to ignore (clarify what's not important like legacy browser support, specific UI frameworks, certain performance metrics).

### Coaching
Example addition: "For mid-level to senior developers building enterprise browser extensions, optimizing for maintainability and multi-browser compatibility while ignoring legacy browser support and minor performance variations."

## Summary Analysis

**Strong Performance**: PUR-002 shows excellent results with 13 out of 15 analyzable BrainLifts passing (87% success rate). Only 2 BrainLifts failed this assessment, with 1 being unanalyzable due to missing content.

**Key Success Patterns**:
- **Clear Target Users**: Successful BrainLifts specified who would use the knowledge (TPMs, engineers, product teams, etc.)
- **Explicit Constraints**: Winners articulated specific limitations and boundaries for the problem space
- **Optimization Variables**: Most passing BrainLifts clearly stated what should be maximized vs. what could be ignored
- **Background Context**: Successful entries provided adequate setup context about the user's environment

**Common Failure Points**:
- **Generic Context**: BrainLift 3 failed due to vague references like "BrainLift-aligned projects" without specificity
- **Missing User Specification**: Failure to clearly identify target users and their specific constraints
- **Incomplete Variable Definition**: Not specifying what should be optimized versus what's less important

**Best Practice Examples**:
- **MarTech SMB Acquisition**: Excellent constraint specification with clear financial and operational requirements
- **RCA BrainLift**: Comprehensive context including user types, cultural constraints, and optimization targets
- **Crossover Hire BrainLift**: Clear methodology focus with explicit exclusions and user specifications

**Coaching Insights**:
The failures primarily stemmed from generic rather than specific context descriptions. When BrainLifts succeeded, they provided concrete details about:
- **Who** will use this knowledge
- **What constraints** they operate under
- **Which variables** matter most vs. least
- **What background** context is relevant

**Overall Assessment**: PUR-002 demonstrates that most authors understand the importance of user-specific context. The high success rate indicates strong contextual thinking, with failures occurring when authors remain too generic in their descriptions rather than getting specific about user needs and constraints.
