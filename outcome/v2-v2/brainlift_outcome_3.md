**Total Assessments**: 8  
**Passed**: 5 | **Failed**: 3

---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - capturing current best practices of Web Extension development and establishing a reusable baseline for BrainLift-aligned projects.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks user-specific context about constraints, operational setup, and important variables to optimize or ignore in web extension development.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Add specific context about your development environment: Are you building for enterprise deployment with security restrictions? Consumer apps with performance constraints? Team size and maintenance capacity? Specify what to optimize (development speed vs. runtime performance vs. store approval) and what's less important (backward compatibility vs. cutting-edge features). This context will help readers apply your patterns appropriately.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks clear measurable outcomes and doesn't specify target users or specific use cases for the web extension knowledge.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Define success metrics: reduced development time from X to Y days, decreased bug reports by Z%, faster store approval by W%. Specify who will use this (junior developers, senior engineers, teams transitioning to MV3) and for what scenarios (greenfield projects, legacy migrations, specific browser targets). Quantifiable outcomes make the BrainLift's value proposition concrete.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift has domain expertise but lacks a comprehensive experts section to position your insights within competing schools of thought.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Research and establish schools of thought in web extension development: **Framework-First School** (WXT/Plasmo advocates who prioritize tooling), **Vanilla-JS Purists** (who prefer minimal dependencies for extensions), **Performance-First School** (focused on runtime optimization). For each expert, provide: name, main extension development philosophy, why their approach differs from yours, and where to find them (GitHub, Twitter, blogs). This positions your SPOVs as informed choices rather than isolated opinions.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The BrainLift challenges conventional web extension development assumptions, including questioning the use of React in content scripts and advocating for treating storage as an event bus.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The BrainLift incorporates cross-domain insights from distributed systems thinking, applying concepts like eventual consistency and idempotent handlers to extension architecture.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Well-structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive DOK1-DOK2 sections covering framework usage, messaging patterns, permissions, and state management.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong controversial SPOVs with high importance, including bold positions on framework necessity, React anti-patterns, and distributed system design principles for extensions.
