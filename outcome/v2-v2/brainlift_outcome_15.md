---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - becoming the global expert on how students use learning apps to achieve 2x academic growth.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (digital technology focus, excluding traditional classroom methods) and variables to optimize (2x academic growth, establishing thought leadership).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates clear outcomes (revolutionize digital education for millions of students) and specifies measurable goals (2x academic growth) with defined scope for digital learning applications.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section with 6 relevant learning analytics and educational technology experts including Justin Skycak, Dr. Ryan Baker, Steven Anderson, Dr. Sidney D'Mello, and Andrew Olney, with detailed credentials and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your digital learning framework addresses behavioral challenges but doesn't question fundamental assumptions about digital acceleration, measurement methods, and the relationship between app usage and academic success.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That 2x academic growth is universally beneficial (what if accelerated learning creates gaps or stress?), 2) That digital apps are superior to human teaching (what if social learning is irreplaceable?), 3) That behavioral interventions improve learning (what if they create learned helplessness?). Question whether "gaming the system" behaviors are problems to solve or symptoms of poor instructional design, and if standardized growth metrics capture true educational value.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your learning effectiveness insights focus on educational technology without exploring how other domains handle skill acquisition, behavioral change, and performance optimization in high-stakes learning environments.

### Coaching

Study approaches from athletic training, musical education, and military instruction: 1) Sports psychology's approach to maintaining engagement during difficulty, 2) Music education's scaffolding techniques for complex skill development, 3) Military training's resilience building under stress. These domains have solved similar challenges of maintaining motivation during struggle while achieving accelerated skill acquisition with different intervention strategies.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Well-structured Knowledge Tree with detailed sections covering digital learning mastery behaviors, learning app design principles, and AI tutoring systems with comprehensive DOK1-DOK2 structure.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including positions on intervening before frustration thresholds (2-3 wrong answers), automatic instructional method pivoting, and the hierarchy of engagement over correctness.
