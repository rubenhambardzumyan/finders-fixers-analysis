### Feedback

Your knowledge foundation appears incomplete - while you have strong DOK4 SPOVs and expert coverage, the Knowledge Tree section appears truncated with limited comprehensive coverage of your learning effectiveness domain.

### Coaching

Expand your Knowledge Tree with comprehensive coverage of: (1) Student behavior patterns with specific intervention thresholds and outcomes, (2) App design principles with implementation examples and effectiveness metrics, (3) Learning science research with specific studies and findings, and (4) Engagement measurement approaches with validated assessment tools.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - becoming a global expert on how students achieve 2x academic growth using learning apps with scope for revolutionizing digital education.

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is focused on digital learning expertise with clear boundaries excluding traditional classroom methods. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose covers learning effectiveness and student behavior but misses critical educational implementation and policy decision areas.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) App recommendation strategy - criteria for matching students with appropriate learning applications, (2) Teacher integration approach - level of educator involvement in app-based learning, and (3) Assessment alignment - integrating app-based learning metrics with traditional educational evaluation systems.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs covering preemptive intervention timing and automatic teaching method adaptation for struggling students.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

You have strong behavioral intervention stances but missing positions on equally critical educational philosophy and implementation areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Personalization philosophy - extent of individualized learning paths vs. standardized curricula in digital environments, (2) Screen time boundaries - optimal balance between digital and non-digital learning activities, and (3) Data privacy approach - acceptable levels of student behavior tracking for learning improvement.
