---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - developing comprehensive understanding of Lithium's SMS product to drive backlog decisions for defensive and offensive strategies.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (focus on architectural advantages, technical differentiation) and variables to optimize (prioritization decisions, strategic insights for CTOs and CEOs).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates clear outcomes (guide prioritization and technical strategic decisions) and specifies target users (CTOs/TPMs and CEOs) with defined scope for telecom SMS systems.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Relevant experts section with 3 telecom specialists including Enrico Marocco, Philippe Kahn, and Danielle Rios, with detailed credentials and expertise areas.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your SMS platform strategy challenges some telecom assumptions but doesn't question fundamental beliefs about cloud migration strategies and legacy system modernization approaches.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That cloud-native always outperforms optimized legacy systems (what if hybrid architectures provide better economics?), 2) That microservices reduce complexity (what if they create operational overhead that negates benefits?), 3) That 5G adoption drives immediate change (what if operators delay migrations for years?). Question whether "lift-and-shift is funeral march" or if gradual modernization preserves more value while reducing risk.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your Lithium insights focus on telecom industry practices without exploring how other domains handle similar infrastructure modernization and routing optimization challenges.

### Coaching

Study approaches from financial trading systems, content delivery networks, and industrial control systems: 1) High-frequency trading's low-latency routing for message optimization, 2) CDN edge computing for distributed processing models, 3) Industrial automation's migration from proprietary to standard protocols. These domains have solved similar problems of maintaining reliability while modernizing critical infrastructure with different risk profiles.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive Knowledge Tree with detailed DOK1-DOK3 sections covering core architecture, protocol abstraction, integration patterns, and operational requirements.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including bold positions on cloud-native necessity, runtime rule compilation, and the "invisible hand" of operational stability as competitive advantage.
