## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift demonstrates extensive knowledge about Cursor IDE but completely lacks an Experts section, missing the opportunity to position your insights within the broader landscape of AI-assisted development approaches.

### Coaching

**School of Thought 1: AI-First Development**
- **Expert**: Amjad Masad (@amasad) - CEO of Replit, advocate for AI-native development environments
- **Main Views**: Development tools should be built around AI from the ground up, not AI features bolted onto traditional IDEs
- **Where to Find**: @amasad on Twitter

**School of Thought 2: Human-AI Collaboration**  
- **Expert**: Simon Willison (@simonw) - Creator of Datasette, focuses on AI-human collaboration patterns
- **Main Views**: AI should augment human decision-making rather than replace it; emphasis on understanding AI outputs
- **Where to Find**: @simonw on Twitter

**School of Thought 3: Traditional IDE Enhancement**
- **Expert**: Scott Hanselman (@shanselman) - Microsoft principal developer advocate
- **Main Views**: AI features should enhance existing development workflows without fundamentally changing proven practices
- **Where to Find**: @shanselman on Twitter

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift challenges conventional development practices by positioning AI as transformative rather than assistive, questioning traditional debugging and code review workflows.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the AI-assisted IDE domain instead of learning from other human-computer collaboration paradigms.

### Coaching

Study how creative professionals use AI tools (Adobe Creative Suite AI features, Figma plugins), examine how pilots interact with autopilot systems, and learn from pair programming methodologies. Also explore research on human-AI teaming in other domains like medical diagnosis or financial analysis.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your knowledge foundation appears incomplete - while you have strong DOK3 insights and DOK4 SPOVs, the Knowledge Tree section appears truncated with limited DOK1 facts and DOK2 summaries.

### Coaching

Expand your Knowledge Tree with comprehensive coverage of: (1) Specific Cursor features with usage examples and performance benchmarks, (2) AI prompting patterns with before/after code examples, (3) Team collaboration workflows with configuration examples, and (4) Integration patterns with other development tools and version control systems.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - mastering advanced Cursor IDE usage patterns to maximize developer productivity through AI-assisted development.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is well-focused on Cursor IDE mastery with clear objectives and scope boundaries. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose covers individual productivity techniques but misses critical team adoption and organizational decision areas.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Team adoption strategy - how to migrate teams from traditional IDEs to AI-assisted development, (2) Skill development paths - training approaches for different developer experience levels, and (3) Quality assurance integration - how to maintain code quality standards while leveraging AI assistance.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs covering AI prompting transformation, local-first development, context-aware completions, team-wide standards, and code review evolution.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

You have strong technical productivity stances but missing positions on equally critical team dynamics and organizational change areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Learning investment - how much time teams should spend learning AI-assisted development vs. shipping features, (2) Code ownership - how AI-generated code affects responsibility and debugging ownership, and (3) Skill evolution - whether traditional programming skills become less important with advanced AI assistance.
