## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - mastering advanced usage patterns of Cursor IDE to maximize developer productivity through AI-assisted development.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (team-specific coding standards, context management) and variables to maximize (productivity, code quality, intuitive workflows).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates clear outcomes (faster development cycles, higher code quality) and specifies target users (developers seeking to leverage Cursor's AI capabilities effectively).

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section with 5 Cursor team members including founders and technical leaders, with detailed roles, expertise areas, and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your Cursor mastery guide focuses on AI productivity techniques but doesn't challenge fundamental assumptions about developer workflows and tool adoption patterns.

### Coaching

Question these domain assumptions: 1) That individual productivity improvements automatically translate to team velocity (what if AI assistance creates knowledge silos?), 2) That AI-first development reduces technical debt (what if over-reliance on AI suggestions creates maintenance burdens?), 3) That prompt engineering is a developer skill (what if it should be a separate role like DevOps?). Challenge whether "AI-assisted" is the end goal or just a stepping stone to fully autonomous development.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your Cursor insights stay within AI-assisted development orthodoxy without exploring how other domains have successfully integrated AI assistance into complex workflows.

### Coaching

Study AI integration from creative industries, financial trading, and medical diagnosis: 1) Film industry's AI-assisted editing workflows for collaborative creative processes, 2) Algorithmic trading's human-AI decision systems for high-stakes automation, 3) Medical AI diagnostic tools' human oversight patterns for critical decision-making. These domains balance AI assistance with human expertise differently than current software development practices suggest.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Well-structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive DOK1-DOK3 sections covering workflows, team practices, command efficiency, and AI interaction patterns.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including bold positions on AI transforming developers into solution architects and local-first AI development rewriting debugging workflows.
