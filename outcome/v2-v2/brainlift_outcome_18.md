## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - capturing Trilogy's specific point of view on how to run legacy enterprise software during acquisition.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks user-specific context about constraints, operational setup, and important variables to optimize in running acquired enterprise software companies.

### Coaching

Add specific context about Trilogy's acquisition environment: size of target companies, typical financial condition of acquisitions, existing infrastructure capacity, and operational constraints. Specify what to optimize (cost reduction vs. growth vs. integration speed) and what's unique about Trilogy's approach versus other private equity or strategic acquirers. This context helps readers understand when Trilogy's methods apply versus other acquisition strategies.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks clear measurable outcomes and doesn't specify target users or specific use cases for the enterprise software management knowledge.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Define success metrics: time to operational stability, cost reduction percentages, customer retention rates post-acquisition. Specify who will use this (acquisition teams, engineering managers, operations leaders) and for what scenarios (SaaS turnarounds, enterprise software rescues, specific industry verticals). Clear outcomes make Trilogy's approach to enterprise software management measurable and replicable.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a comprehensive experts section to position your insights within competing schools of thought about enterprise software acquisition and management.

### Relevant Lesson

[BrainLift 110: Pick the BrainLift You Need to Create](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

### Coaching

Research schools of thought in enterprise software M&A: **Platform Consolidation School** (like Trilogy), **Best-of-Breed Preservation School** (maintaining separate systems), **Modernization-First School** (immediate cloud migration). Include experts from other software roll-up companies, private equity firms, and turnaround specialists with their philosophies on managing acquired software companies and balancing operational efficiency with customer retention.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift contains minimal content that doesn't demonstrate challenging conventional assumptions about enterprise software management, acquisition integration, or operational turnaround strategies.

### Coaching

Develop challenging perspectives about enterprise software assumptions: 1) That customer-centric approaches are always optimal (what if operational efficiency drives better outcomes?), 2) That gradual change reduces churn risk (what if bold moves command more respect?), 3) That high availability is universally necessary (what if it's expensive theater for most customers?). Question whether "turning around bad companies" with standard processes actually works or if each situation requires unique solutions.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks insights and doesn't explore how other domains handle operational turnarounds, legacy system management, and organizational transformation in distressed asset situations.

### Coaching

Study approaches from distressed retail chains, manufacturing turnarounds, and hospital system rescues: 1) Retail turnaround specialists' approach to operational standardization while maintaining brand identity, 2) Manufacturing restructuring strategies for legacy equipment and workforce optimization, 3) Hospital turnarounds balancing cost reduction with patient care quality. These domains have solved similar challenges of operational transformation while maintaining service delivery.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive DOK sections covering the fundamentals, patterns, and methodologies for running acquired enterprise software companies.

### Coaching

Develop comprehensive knowledge areas: 1) Acquisition Assessment Frameworks (evaluating software company health), 2) Cloud Migration Strategies (AWS-first implementation approaches), 3) Customer Retention Models (maintaining service during transitions), 4) Operational Efficiency Patterns (standardizing processes across acquisitions). Each area should include detailed facts, practical examples, and proven methodologies from Trilogy's experience.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Contains a strong SPOV about AWS vendor lock-in being advantageous for running lean organizations, which represents a controversial position with high importance for enterprise software strategy and operational philosophy.
