### Feedback

Your recruiting insights focus on talent acquisition practices without exploring how other domains handle global talent identification, objective assessment, and performance prediction in high-stakes selection processes.

### Coaching

Study approaches from professional sports scouting, military officer selection, and academic research hiring: 1) Professional sports' global scouting networks and objective performance measurement, 2) Military academies' cognitive and leadership assessment for officer selection, 3) Academic institutions' peer review and objective research evaluation systems. These domains have solved similar challenges of identifying top performers from global pools while managing bias and predicting success with different assessment methodologies.
