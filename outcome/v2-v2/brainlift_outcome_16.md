### Feedback

You have strong assessment and process stances but missing positions on equally critical candidate experience and organizational change areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Candidate feedback philosophy - level of transparency about assessment results and improvement areas, (2) Hiring velocity vs. quality trade-offs - acceptable time-to-hire for top talent acquisition, and (3) Internal hiring manager development - training investment vs. replacement for those who can't adapt to objective hiring methods.
