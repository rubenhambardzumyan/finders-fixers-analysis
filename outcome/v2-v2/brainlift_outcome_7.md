**Total Assessments**: 9  
**Passed**: 3 | **Failed**: 6

---

## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift demonstrates deep domain knowledge but completely lacks an Experts section, missing the opportunity to position your insights within the broader landscape of mathematics education approaches.

### Coaching

**School of Thought 1: Cognitive Load Theory**
- **Expert**: John Sweller - Originator of Cognitive Load Theory
- **Main Views**: Learning should minimize extraneous cognitive load while optimizing intrinsic and germane load through careful instructional design
- **Where to Find**: University of New South Wales, academic publications

**School of Thought 2: Spaced Practice Optimization**  
- **Expert**: Hal Pashler (@halpashler) - UCSD cognitive psychologist
- **Main Views**: Distributed practice with optimal spacing intervals is more effective than massed practice for long-term retention
- **Where to Find**: @halpashler on Twitter

**School of Thought 3: Gamification in Education**
- **Expert**: Jane McGonigal (@avantgame) - Game designer and researcher
- **Main Views**: Well-designed games can create optimal learning conditions through engagement, feedback, and progressive challenges
- **Where to Find**: @avantgame on Twitter

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift challenges conventional educational practices by advocating for hard gates (95% accuracy) vs. typical soft progression, and questioning the traditional approach of long study sessions in favor of short, focused bursts.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the math education domain instead of learning from other skill acquisition fields that face similar fluency and automation challenges.

### Coaching

Study how musicians develop technical fluency (scales, arpeggios), how athletes build motor skill automaticity, and how language learning approaches vocabulary acquisition. Also examine how video games create skill progression systems and how military training develops tactical decision-making speed.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your knowledge foundation appears incomplete - while you have strong DOK3 insights and DOK4 SPOVs, the Knowledge Tree section is missing, leaving your claims without proper factual support.

### Coaching

Create a comprehensive Knowledge Tree with: (1) Cognitive science research on math fact fluency with specific studies and findings, (2) Educational psychology principles with implementation examples, (3) Game design research on motivation and engagement, and (4) Assessment and measurement approaches with validation studies.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - encapsulating educational science knowledge around math fluency to drive AI-First game development decisions.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is focused on knowledge capture for product development with clear scope boundaries. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose focuses on game development insights but misses critical educational implementation and pedagogical decision areas.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Individual vs. classroom implementation - how to adapt personalized algorithms for group learning settings, (2) Assessment integration - how to align game-based fluency measures with traditional educational assessments, and (3) Teacher involvement - level of educator oversight and intervention required for optimal outcomes.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs covering the mastery-fluency-reinforcement progression, session duration limits, hard gate requirements, adaptive drill sizing, and practice fidelity enforcement.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

You have strong instructional design stances but missing positions on equally critical educational philosophy and implementation areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation - role of rewards and gamification in math learning, (2) Error handling philosophy - whether mistakes should be immediately corrected or used as learning opportunities, and (3) Differentiation approach - how to handle students with learning differences or math anxiety within the same system.
