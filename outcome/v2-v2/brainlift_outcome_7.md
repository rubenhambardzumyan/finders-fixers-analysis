---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - encapsulating educational science knowledge around math fluency to drive AI-First game development product decisions.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context about constraints (not execution oriented, focused on educational science) and variables to optimize (accurate understanding, fluency building, spaced reinforcement).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates clear outcomes (driving product development decisions) and specifies scope for AI-First game development projects with measurable goals like 95% accuracy and 40 CQPM.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section with 6 relevant educational experts including Sara VanDer Werf, Greg Tang, Jennifer Bay-Williams, and the Engelmann family, with detailed credentials and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your math fluency framework challenges some educational assumptions but doesn't question fundamental beliefs about learning, assessment, and motivation in educational game design.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That timed assessments are necessary for fluency measurement (what if stress-free, ongoing observation provides better data?), 2) That individual progression is optimal (what if peer learning accelerates fluency better?), 3) That accuracy must precede speed (what if simultaneous development is more natural?). Question whether "hard gates" truly prevent gaps or create anxiety that impedes learning. Consider if gamification rewards might undermine intrinsic mathematical curiosity.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your math fluency insights focus on educational research without exploring how other domains handle skill acquisition, automaticity, and performance optimization.

### Coaching

Import frameworks from athletic training, musical practice, and cognitive rehabilitation: 1) Sports training's progressive overload principles for building mathematical stamina, 2) Music education's deliberate practice techniques for achieving automaticity, 3) Cognitive therapy's errorless learning approaches for building confidence. These domains have solved similar challenges of moving from conscious effort to automatic performance with different motivational and progression strategies.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Extremely well-structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive DOK1-DOK4 sections covering fluency definitions, learning goals, instructional models, cognitive science principles, and practice techniques.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including positions on the universal game arc, hard gates with 95% accuracy requirements, and auto-sizing drill mechanisms that challenge conventional educational approaches.
