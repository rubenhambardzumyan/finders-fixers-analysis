## EXP-001 Assessment

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift explicitly challenges conventional M&A integration approaches by advocating for brutal knowledge extraction timelines, complete feature development cessation, and immediate AI transformation over gradual integration.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the software acquisition domain instead of learning from other industries that have mastered rapid organizational and technical integration.

### Coaching

Study how private equity firms handle operational integration (KKR, Blackstone), how consulting companies integrate acquired practices (McKinsey acquisitions), and how manufacturing companies merge production systems. Learn from military acquisition integration processes and how healthcare systems merge clinical operations.

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Solid knowledge foundation with clear DOK structure, specific integration outcomes, tactical approaches, and concrete examples from acquisition failures and successes.

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - codifying best practices for technical import/integration of acquired companies with specific timeline and success criteria.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is well-focused on technical integration execution with clear scope boundaries and specific success metrics. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose covers technical integration processes but misses critical cultural integration and change management decision areas.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Team retention strategy - which legacy team members to retain vs. transition out during integration, (2) Communication management - how to handle customer and stakeholder communications during disruptive changes, and (3) Risk mitigation - acceptable levels of short-term disruption for long-term transformation benefits.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs covering rapid knowledge extraction, AI-first value creation, immediate feature development cessation, and sunk cost disregard for unshipped features.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

You have strong operational integration stances but missing positions on equally critical strategic and cultural transformation areas.

### Coaching

Add clear positions on: (1) Cultural integration approach - how aggressively to impose new company culture vs. preserving valuable legacy practices, (2) Customer communication strategy - transparency level about integration disruptions and transformation plans, and (3) Value creation timeline - acceptable short-term revenue impact for long-term AI transformation benefits.
