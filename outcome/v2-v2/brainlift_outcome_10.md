---

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - codifying best practices for technical import/integration of acquired companies with the goal of executing import in one quarter without causing customer churn.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks user-specific context about constraints, operational setup, and important variables to optimize in the acquisition integration process.

### Coaching

Add specific context about your acquisition environment: size of target companies, existing technical infrastructure capacity, compliance requirements, and risk tolerance. Specify what to optimize (speed vs. stability vs. cost reduction) and what constraints exist (regulatory approvals, customer contract terms, existing team capacity). This context helps readers understand when and how to apply your integration patterns.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks clear measurable outcomes and doesn't specify target users or specific use cases for the integration knowledge.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Define success metrics: complete integration in X quarters, customer churn below Y%, infrastructure cost reduction of Z%. Specify who will use this (TPMs, engineering leads, SaaS operations teams) and for what scenarios (SaaS acquisitions, on-premise integrations, specific technology stacks). Clear metrics make the integration framework's effectiveness measurable.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift has domain expertise but lacks a comprehensive experts section to position your insights within competing schools of thought.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Research schools of thought in M&A integration: **Speed-First School** (emphasizing rapid integration), **Preservation School** (maintaining existing systems longer), **AI-First Transformation School** (immediate modernization through AI). For each expert, provide: name, main integration philosophy, specific M&A track record, and contact information. This positions your aggressive timeline approach as one strategy among several.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The BrainLift challenges conventional M&A assumptions, particularly around feature development termination and the "swan song" principle of treating unshipped features as liabilities.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your integration insights focus on software M&A practices without exploring how other domains handle rapid organizational integration and knowledge transfer challenges.

### Coaching

Study approaches from military unit integration, hospital system mergers, and manufacturing acquisitions: 1) Military's rapid unit integration protocols for maintaining operational readiness, 2) Healthcare system mergers' patient continuity strategies during transitions, 3) Manufacturing acquisitions' production line integration without quality disruption. These domains solve similar challenges of rapid capability transfer while maintaining service continuity.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Knowledge Tree contains structured insights about integration outcomes, TPM roles, communication resets, and project management during acquisitions.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including positions on brutal knowledge extraction timelines, feature development termination, and AI-first value creation over product integration.
