## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The Experts section contains comprehensive expert entries with relevant authorities in MarTech pricing, retention, and AI monetization.

### Analysis
The BrainLift includes 10 well-qualified experts covering key domains: Patrick Campbell (ProfitWell), Elena Verna (growth/retention), Kyle Poyar (usage-based pricing), and others with clear credentials and relevance to the MarTech acquisition context.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: This BrainLift explicitly challenges widely accepted MarTech domain practices and unspoken assumptions.

### Analysis
The BrainLift challenges several orthodox assumptions:
- That SMB customers inherently have low stickiness and require aggressive price increases
- That AI features should be premium add-ons rather than core value drivers
- That monthly contracts prevent achieving high margins and retention
- That traditional ESW playbooks cannot apply to SMB MarTech

The content systematically questions "everyone knows" beliefs about SMB monetization and presents contrarian approaches.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift incorporates extensive cross-domain insights that challenge MarTech orthodox thinking.

### Analysis
Cross-domain knowledge integration includes:
- Traditional private equity playbooks applied to MarTech
- AI/ML pricing models from enterprise software
- Consumer subscription psychology
- Data monetization strategies from other industries
- Outcome-based pricing from services industries

These external perspectives challenge domain-specific assumptions about SMB customer behavior and pricing strategies.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The Knowledge Tree clearly organizes the knowledge landscape relevant to the MarTech acquisition problem domain.

### Analysis
The Knowledge Tree is well-structured around five core knowledge areas:
- Customer Success (retention strategies, AI automation)
- Product-Led Expansion (usage pricing, value alignment)  
- Retention (predictive analytics, churn mechanics)
- Pricing & Packaging (hybrid models, localization, experimentation)
- Cost To Serve (automation, efficiency optimization)

Each area contains relevant DOK2 summaries and DOK1 facts that build toward the BrainLift's purpose.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The purpose statement contains clear, well-defined problems to solve.

### Analysis
The purpose clearly articulates the core problem: "how to acquire and operate lower left quadrant MarTech companies with SMB customers and monthly contracts, while maintaining vital aspects of the traditional ESW playbook (75% net margin, 100% customer success)."

A secondary problem is also defined: establishing alternative pricing and packaging strategies that achieve 90%+ net dollar retention without aggressive price increases.

---

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The purpose statement includes clear user-specific context, constraints, and optimization variables.

### Analysis
User-specific context includes:
- Background: MarTech companies with SMB customers and monthly contracts
- Constraints: Must maintain 75% net margin and 100% customer success
- Variables to maximize: 90%+ net dollar retention (NDR/NRR)
- Constraint: Avoid aggressive price increases that don't work for low-stickiness customers

The context is specific to acquisition teams operating in the MarTech space with particular financial and operational requirements.

---

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The purpose statement articulates clear, measurable outcomes with business metrics and usage scope.

### Analysis
Measurable outcomes include:
- 75% net margin (financial metric)
- 100% customer success (operational metric)  
- 90%+ net dollar retention (growth metric)

Target users: Acquisition teams, private equity professionals, MarTech operators
Use cases: Acquiring and operating SMB-focused MarTech companies with monthly contracts

The metrics are tied to clear business impact and the scope of application is well-defined.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All SPOVs demonstrate high importance and sufficient controversy for the MarTech acquisition domain.

### Analysis
**SPOV 1** (Double prices with AI value): High importance for acquisition success, high controversy challenging conventional pricing wisdom.

**SPOV 2** (Future of marketing/AI agents): High importance for long-term viability, high controversy on timing and adoption rates.

**SPOV 3** (Outcome-metered AI features): High importance for NRR expansion, moderate-high controversy on customer acceptance of outcome pricing.

**SPOV 4** (Pricing/packaging experiments): High importance for immediate revenue impact, moderate controversy on SMB A/B testing feasibility.

**SPOV 5** (AI "segment-of-one" GTM): High importance for efficiency gains, high controversy on AI personalization at scale.

**SPOV 6** (100% AI support/renewals): High importance for cost structure, high controversy on complete human replacement.

**SPOV 7** (AI-first hiring): High importance for operational efficiency, high controversy on replacing domain expertise.

All SPOVs represent positions where domain experts would actively disagree on feasibility, timing, or approach.
