---

## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Comprehensive experts section exists with 10 relevant domain experts, all with detailed descriptions, clear relevance explanations, and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The BrainLift explicitly challenges conventional wisdom, particularly around AI pricing strategies, SMB customer management, and the feasibility of achieving high margins with monthly contracts - directly questioning accepted domain practices.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your MarTech insights stay within the SaaS/subscription business bubble instead of learning from other industries that face similar retention and pricing challenges.

### Coaching

Study how subscription businesses in media (Netflix pricing tiers), fitness (Peloton's hardware-software model), or telecommunications (bundling strategies) handle similar retention challenges. Cross-industry patterns often reveal breakthrough approaches that MarTech hasn't considered.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong knowledge foundation with comprehensive DOK structure - extensive DOK1 facts with proper attribution, synthesized DOK2 summaries, strategic DOK3 insights, and actionable DOK4 SPOVs.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - establishing a playbook for acquiring and operating MarTech SMB companies while maintaining specific financial targets (75% margin, 90%+ NDR).

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement contains competing objectives that could confuse decision-making when trade-offs are required between margin preservation and retention optimization.

### Coaching

Clarify the primary objective hierarchy. When forced to choose between maintaining 75% margins and achieving 90%+ NDR, which takes precedence? Build a decision framework that guides choices when these goals conflict, such as "Prioritize NDR up to 85% margin floor, then optimize margins."

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose covers pricing and retention but misses critical operational decision areas that acquisition teams face daily.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Target identification criteria - what qualifies as "lower left quadrant" MarTech, (2) Integration sequencing - which systems and processes to merge first, and (3) Cultural alignment assessment - how to evaluate team compatibility during due diligence.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Strong SPOVs present covering AI pricing strategy, market evolution predictions, automation approaches, and hiring philosophy - all representing clear, actionable stances.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The existing SPOVs adequately cover the major decision points for MarTech SMB acquisitions. Additional stances would likely be refinements rather than fundamentally different decision areas.
