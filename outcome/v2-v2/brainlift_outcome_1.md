## PUR-001 Assessment

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear user-specific context including specific constraints (75% net margin, 100% customer success) and variables to maximize (90%+ NDR rather than aggressive price increases).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates clear, measurable outcomes (75% net margin, 90%+ NDR, 100% customer success) and specifies scope for SMB MarTech companies with monthly contracts.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section exists with 10 relevant experts, complete with names, descriptions, relevance explanations, and Twitter handles.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your MarTech acquisition playbook focuses on proven strategies but misses opportunities to challenge conventional wisdom about SMB retention and AI monetization timing.

### Coaching

Question these domain assumptions: 1) That SMB customers inherently have lower switching costs (what if bundling + outcome-pricing creates unexpected stickiness?), 2) That AI features should be monetized immediately (what if free AI drives core product adoption better?), 3) That monthly contracts mean less commitment (what if monthly allows faster expansion testing?). Challenge the assumption that "low-touch" means "low-value" - investigate how Netflix keeps entertainment subscribers without high-touch success teams.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within MarTech/SaaS orthodoxy without leveraging cross-domain strategies that could challenge your retention and pricing assumptions.

### Coaching

Import insights from subscription businesses facing similar retention challenges: 1) Study how Netflix uses data exhaust for content personalization - apply this to MarTech feature recommendations, 2) Examine how Spotify bundles podcasts with music - model for MarTech feature bundling, 3) Learn from gym membership retention strategies using habit formation - relevant for low-touch SMB engagement. These domains solve expansion revenue differently than traditional SaaS playbooks suggest.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The BrainLift has well-organized Knowledge Tree section with clear DOK1-DOK4 structure covering pricing, retention, cost optimization, and expert perspectives.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Multiple SPOVs demonstrate high importance and controversy, including contrarian positions on AI pricing timing, outcome-based pricing adoption, and human resource replacement in customer success.
