## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift demonstrates comprehensive monitoring knowledge but completely lacks an Experts section, missing the opportunity to position your insights within the broader landscape of enterprise monitoring and observability approaches.

### Coaching

**School of Thought 1: Observability-First Architecture**
- **Expert**: Charity Majors (@mipsytipsy) - CTO of Honeycomb

**School of Thought 2: SRE-Driven Monitoring**  
- **Expert**: Ben Treynor Sloss - VP of Engineering at Google, creator of SRE
- **Main Views**: Monitoring should focus on user experience metrics and error budgets rather than infrastructure metrics
- **Where to Find**: Google SRE publications and conferences

**School of Thought 3: Business-Impact Monitoring**
- **Expert**: Liz Fong-Jones (@lizthegrey) - Principal Developer Advocate at Honeycomb
- **Main Views**: Monitoring should prioritize business-critical user journeys over technical metrics

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift accepts conventional monitoring approaches without challenging widely accepted practices in enterprise observability and incident prevention.

### Coaching

Challenge assumptions like "more monitoring equals better reliability" - explore how excessive alerting creates noise and alert fatigue. Question whether traditional infrastructure monitoring provides meaningful insights for user experience, and examine why organizations focus on technical metrics instead of business outcomes.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights stay within the enterprise software monitoring domain instead of learning from other industries that have mastered reliability and failure prevention.

### Coaching

Study how aviation industry handles system monitoring and failure prediction, examine how manufacturing uses predictive maintenance, and learn from telecommunications network monitoring approaches. Also explore how financial trading systems handle real-time failure detection and automatic failover.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your knowledge foundation appears incomplete - while you have clear purpose and scope definition, the Knowledge Tree section appears missing or truncated, lacking comprehensive DOK1 facts and DOK2 summaries.

### Coaching

Create a comprehensive Knowledge Tree with: (1) Monitoring tools and technologies with performance benchmarks and use cases, (2) Synthetic monitoring patterns with implementation examples, (3) APM strategies with customer impact metrics, and (4) Legacy system observability approaches with successful transformation case studies.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Clear problem definition exists - developing comprehensive framework for application and synthetic monitoring to prevent embarrassing outages in enterprise software acquisitions.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: Purpose is well-focused on monitoring framework development with clear background context and specific success criteria. No competing objectives identified.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose covers monitoring strategy and implementation but misses critical organizational and resource decision areas for enterprise monitoring programs.

### Coaching

Add decision frameworks for: (1) Alert escalation and on-call management - balancing coverage with team burnout, (2) Monitoring investment prioritization - resource allocation between preventive monitoring vs. reactive incident response, and (3) Customer communication - transparency levels about system health and planned maintenance during monitoring improvements.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a DOK4 SPOVs section entirely, missing the opportunity to take strong, actionable positions on monitoring philosophy and strategy.

### Coaching

Develop clear SPOVs on: (1) Monitoring philosophy - whether to focus on user experience vs. system health metrics, (2) Alert strategy - preference for proactive prevention vs. rapid response to incidents, and (3) Tool consolidation - building unified monitoring vs. best-of-breed specialized tools.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Without any SPOVs present, there are no positions to evaluate for additional critical decision areas.

### Coaching

Since no SPOVs exist, first address the missing DOK4 section, then consider additional decision areas like automation boundaries, team responsibility models, and vendor vs. build-internal monitoring decisions.
