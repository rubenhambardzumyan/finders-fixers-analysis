## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement clearly defines the problem - developing a comprehensive framework for application and synthetic monitoring to prevent embarrassing outages in enterprise software acquisitions.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement contains clear context including constraints (legacy software burden, heterogeneous technology stacks, enterprise customer requirements) and variables to optimize (preventing embarrassing outages vs. cost scaling).

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: The purpose statement articulates clear outcomes (prevent customer-facing failures, create repeatable monitoring playbooks) and specifies scope for legacy enterprise software monitoring with defined success criteria.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Comprehensive experts section with multiple schools of thought including Minimalist School (John Allspaw), Synthetic Monitoring Pragmatists (Mehdi Daoudi), Legacy System Realists (Michael Nygard), and others with detailed viewpoints and contact information.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your monitoring framework challenges some technical assumptions but doesn't question fundamental beliefs about system reliability, observability philosophy, and organizational monitoring culture.

### Coaching

Challenge these domain assumptions: 1) That more monitoring data leads to better insights (what if minimal, focused monitoring is more effective?), 2) That preventive monitoring reduces downtime (what if detection and response are more valuable?), 3) That technical teams should own monitoring (what if business teams better understand what matters?). Question whether "embarrassing outages" are technical problems or communication/expectation management issues.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your monitoring insights focus on software operations without exploring how other domains handle system health monitoring and failure prevention in complex environments.

### Coaching

Study approaches from aviation maintenance, power grid management, and medical patient monitoring: 1) Aircraft maintenance's predictive vs. preventive monitoring strategies, 2) Power grid's cascade failure prevention through selective isolation, 3) Hospital monitoring's alarm fatigue management and critical vs. non-critical alerts. These domains have solved similar challenges of monitoring complex systems where failures have serious consequences.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Extremely comprehensive Knowledge Tree with detailed DOK1-DOK3 sections covering monitoring approaches, business value focus, legacy system patterns, and detection vs. prevention philosophy.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Strong SPOVs with high importance and controversy, including radical positions on monitoring minimalism (10 monitors per product), black-box monitoring as the only truth, and product team ownership over centralized monitoring.
