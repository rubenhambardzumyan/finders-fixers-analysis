## EXP-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED  
**Result**: The Experts section only lists internal Khoros team members rather than established external authorities.

### Feedback
The Experts section contains 17 Khoros employees with role descriptions, but lacks external experts who could provide diverse perspectives on community management, public-facing platforms, or customer engagement strategies. This creates an insular view without broader industry insights.

### Coaching

#### Feedback
Your BrainLift relies exclusively on internal perspectives from Khoros team members. While these individuals have deep product knowledge, a comprehensive BrainLift requires external experts who can challenge assumptions, provide alternative approaches, and represent different schools of thought about community engagement and platform architecture.

#### Relevant Lesson
[BrainLift 110: Pick the BrainLift You Need to Create](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

#### Coaching
Add 3-4 external experts such as:
- **Community Management Expert**: Someone like Vanilla Forums CEO or Community Management Institute leader with competing platform experience
- **Customer Experience Authority**: Expert in public-facing brand experiences who can challenge Khoros's approach
- **Technical Architecture Expert**: Authority on high-scale public platforms from companies like Discourse, Stack Overflow, or Reddit
- **Digital Brand Strategy Expert**: Practitioner who questions whether community platforms truly drive customer value vs. traditional support channels

Each expert should bring contrasting viewpoints that would create healthy debate about community platform strategy and implementation.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED  
**Result**: This BrainLift does not challenge widely accepted assumptions about community platform management or customer engagement strategies.

### Feedback
The SPOVs presented are operational decisions (Aurora migration, backend containerization) rather than controversial positions that challenge fundamental assumptions about community platforms, customer engagement, or digital brand strategy.

### Coaching
Challenge assumptions such as:
- **DOK3 Insight**: Question whether community platforms actually increase customer loyalty or just create operational overhead that distracts from product improvement
- **DOK2 Summary**: Challenge the assumption that public-facing platforms enhance brand reputation rather than creating risk surfaces for customer complaints
- **DOK1 Fact**: Question whether 24/7 global availability requirements justify the infrastructure costs for most organizations

Consider positions that would make community management experts uncomfortable, such as arguing that most customer communities harm brand perception or that private support channels deliver better business outcomes than public forums.

---

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED  
**Result**: The BrainLift lacks cross-domain insights that could challenge community platform and customer engagement orthodox thinking.

### Feedback
The content stays within the community management and customer service domains without incorporating insights from other fields that could challenge fundamental assumptions about public-facing customer engagement.

### Coaching
Incorporate cross-domain insights such as:
- **Urban Planning**: Apply public space design principles to question how community architecture affects user behavior and brand perception
- **Social Psychology**: Use crowd psychology research to challenge assumptions about public vs. private customer interactions
- **Retail Experience Design**: Apply physical store design principles to question community navigation and customer journey optimization
- **Crisis Management**: Use emergency response protocols to challenge community moderation and incident response assumptions
- **Anthropological Studies**: Apply cultural community research to question one-size-fits-all community platform approaches

Add insights that use external domain knowledge to question how community practitioners think about customer engagement, brand risk, and platform value creation.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The Knowledge Tree comprehensively organizes the knowledge landscape relevant to understanding Khoros Communities as a product platform.

### Analysis
The Knowledge Tree is exceptionally well-structured around:
- Product functionality and customer value propositions
- Customer definition and market positioning
- Technical architecture (Legacy vs. Aurora versions)
- Security and compliance requirements
- Relationship to other Khoros products (Jive comparison)
- Migration challenges and operational considerations

Each area contains detailed DOK2 summaries with extensive supporting DOK1 facts, creating a comprehensive foundation for understanding the platform's capabilities and strategic positioning.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The purpose statement contains a clear problem definition focused on comprehensive platform understanding for TPM strategic decisions.

### Analysis
The purpose clearly states the objective: "understand the Khoros Communities product and the Central TPM approach to it." The scope is customer-focused rather than technically focused, with clear boundaries and practical applications for strategic decision-making.

---

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: The purpose statement includes clear user-specific context and constraints for the Central TPM team approach.

### Analysis
User-specific context includes:
- Background: Central TPM team strategic approach to Khoros Communities
- Focus: Customer-first perspective rather than technical implementation details
- Constraints: Product understanding for strategic decisions, not customer-specific configurations
- Applications: TPM strategic planning and decision support
- Scope: Platform capabilities with basic technical orientation where relevant

The context is specific to TPM teams needing comprehensive platform knowledge for strategic and operational decisions.

---

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED  
**Result**: The purpose statement lacks clear, measurable outcomes and business metrics for TPM strategic decision-making.

### Feedback
While the purpose identifies TPM strategic understanding as the goal, it doesn't specify measurable success criteria or concrete business outcomes that would demonstrate successful platform knowledge application.

### Coaching
Add specific, measurable outcomes such as:
- **Strategic Metrics**: "Enable 90% of TPM decisions to reference customer value analysis" or "Support strategic planning that maintains 95% customer retention during Aurora migration"
- **Operational Metrics**: "Reduce customer onboarding issues by 40% through better platform understanding" or "Accelerate migration timeline by 30% through comprehensive knowledge application"
- **Business Metrics**: "Guide investments that maintain 99.9% uptime during transitions" or "Support pricing strategies that increase ARPU by 15%"
- **Usage Scope**: "For TPM teams managing 100+ enterprise community customers" or "Applicable to community platforms with 50K+ daily active users"

Transform the general understanding goal into concrete TPM success criteria that demonstrate clear strategic value and decision-making impact.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED  
**Result**: The SPOVs lack sufficient controversy and represent operational decisions rather than genuinely debatable strategic positions.

### Feedback
The SPOVs presented (Aurora migration completion, legacy UI removal, backend containerization, Khoros One integration, AI content moderation) are reasonable operational decisions that most platform professionals would agree with rather than controversial positions that would divide community management experts.

### Coaching
Develop SPOVs that genuinely divide community platform experts:
- **Controversial Position**: "Public customer communities harm brand reputation more than they help - private support channels deliver better business outcomes"
- **Debatable Stance**: "AI-first content moderation creates community sterility that reduces authentic engagement"
- **Divisive View**: "24/7 global community availability requirements rarely justify their infrastructure costs for most businesses"
- **Provocative Position**: "Community platform migrations should prioritize cost reduction over feature preservation"

Ask yourself: "What community platform decision would make half of experienced community managers strongly disagree?" Those are the positions that belong in SPOVs.

## Summary

**Total Assessments**: 8  
**Passed**: 3  
**Failed**: 5  

This BrainLift provides comprehensive product knowledge with excellent technical detail and thorough knowledge organization. However, it functions more as internal product documentation than a thought-provoking BrainLift. The lack of external expert perspectives, controversial positions, and cross-domain insights prevents it from challenging conventional wisdom about community platforms. The content would benefit from more strategic questioning of fundamental assumptions about customer community value, public engagement risks, and platform architecture decisions.
