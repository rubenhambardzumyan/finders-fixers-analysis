## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift accepts conventional approaches without challenging widely accepted practices in backlog management and technical debt handling.

### Coaching

Challenge assumptions about the necessity of maintaining large backlogs, question whether feature requests from acquired companies should be preserved, and examine why organizations feel obligated to complete in-progress work rather than starting fresh with new priorities.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your insights appear limited and don't incorporate learning from other industries or domains that face similar resource allocation and prioritization challenges.

### Coaching

Study how private equity firms handle operational improvements after acquisitions, examine how consulting companies manage project transitions, and learn from manufacturing approaches to production line optimization and waste elimination.

## KTR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your knowledge foundation is severely incomplete - the BrainLift appears to be a template or outline with minimal actual content in the DOK3 Insights and Knowledge Tree sections.

### Coaching

Develop comprehensive knowledge coverage including: (1) Backlog analysis frameworks with prioritization criteria, (2) Technical debt assessment methodologies, (3) Resource allocation strategies for acquired companies, and (4) Change management approaches for development teams.

## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement is completely missing, making it impossible to evaluate the clarity of the problem you're trying to solve.

### Coaching

Define a clear purpose statement that explains: the specific problem of backlog management during company acquisitions, the scope of decisions this BrainLift will inform, success criteria for backlog pruning, and boundaries of what's included vs. excluded from your expertise area.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Without a purpose statement, it's impossible to evaluate competing objectives or focus areas.

### Coaching

First establish a clear purpose, then ensure it has a single primary objective rather than trying to address multiple competing goals simultaneously.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Without a defined purpose, critical decision areas cannot be identified or evaluated.

### Coaching

After establishing your purpose, identify the key decision frameworks needed such as: (1) Feature triage criteria, (2) Resource reallocation strategies, and (3) Timeline management for backlog cleanup.

## SPOV-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift has minimal SPOV content with only one position about AWS vendor lock-in, which doesn't seem directly related to backlog management.

### Coaching

Develop clear SPOVs specifically about backlog management such as: (1) Philosophy on preserving vs. discarding inherited work, (2) Prioritization criteria for limited development resources, and (3) Timeline approaches for backlog cleanup during acquisitions.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

With only one unrelated SPOV present, there are no meaningful positions to evaluate for additional critical decision areas.

### Coaching

After developing relevant backlog management SPOVs, consider additional decision areas like team communication about cancelled projects, customer expectation management, and technical documentation requirements for pruned features.
