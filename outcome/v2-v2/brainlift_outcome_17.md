## PUR-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a clear purpose statement defining what specific problems you're solving regarding backlog pruning during import quarters.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Define the specific problem: Are you optimizing resource allocation during acquisitions? Establishing criteria for feature prioritization? Creating frameworks for technical debt assessment? A clear purpose statement should explain why backlog pruning matters during import quarters, what outcomes you're trying to achieve, and how success will be measured. This foundation is essential before developing insights or expertise.

## PUR-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks user-specific context about constraints, operational setup, and important variables to optimize in backlog management during acquisitions.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Add context about your acquisition environment: size of companies being acquired, existing technical infrastructure, timeline constraints, resource availability. Specify what to optimize (development velocity vs. technical debt vs. customer satisfaction) and what constraints exist (budget limitations, team capacity, regulatory requirements). This context helps readers understand when and how to apply your backlog management strategies.

## PUR-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your purpose statement lacks clear measurable outcomes and doesn't specify target users or specific use cases for backlog pruning knowledge.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Define success metrics: reduced time to production deployment, X% improvement in development velocity, Y% reduction in technical debt. Specify who will use this (engineering managers, TPMs, product owners) and for what scenarios (SaaS acquisitions, enterprise software imports, specific technology stacks). Clear outcomes make the backlog management framework's effectiveness measurable.

## EXP-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a comprehensive experts section to position your insights within competing schools of thought about backlog management and acquisition integration.

### Relevant Lesson

### Coaching

Research schools of thought in agile product management and M&A integration: **Technical Debt First School** (prioritizing infrastructure), **Customer Value School** (maintaining feature development), **Consolidation School** (merging duplicate functionalities). Include experts like Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Jez Humble, and acquisition specialists with their philosophies on balancing technical improvements with business continuity during transitions.

## GEN-001 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift contains minimal content that doesn't demonstrate challenging conventional assumptions about backlog management, product development, or acquisition integration strategies.

### Coaching

Develop challenging perspectives on backlog management assumptions: 1) That technical debt must be addressed immediately post-acquisition (what if customer-facing features matter more initially?), 2) That existing backlogs represent valuable priorities (what if they reflect organizational dysfunction?), 3) That gradual integration is safer (what if clean slate approaches work better?). Question whether backlog pruning serves efficiency or just creates the illusion of progress.

## GEN-002 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks insights and doesn't explore how other domains handle resource prioritization, legacy system integration, and operational transitions during organizational changes.

### Coaching

Study approaches from military logistics, hospital system mergers, and manufacturing acquisitions: 1) Military's triage protocols for resource allocation under time constraints, 2) Hospital mergers' patient care continuity during system integration, 3) Manufacturing's production line optimization during facility consolidation. These domains have solved similar challenges of maintaining operations while integrating systems and prioritizing limited resources.

## GEN-003 Assessment

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a structured Knowledge Tree with comprehensive DOK sections covering the fundamentals, patterns, and methodologies for backlog management during acquisitions.

### Coaching

Develop comprehensive knowledge areas: 1) Backlog Assessment Frameworks (criteria for evaluating existing priorities), 2) Resource Allocation Models (balancing technical debt vs. feature development), 3) Integration Timeline Management (phased approach to system consolidation), 4) Stakeholder Communication Strategies (managing expectations during transitions). Each area should include facts, summaries, and practical applications.

## SPOV-002 Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Contains a SPOV about AWS vendor lock-in being advantageous for running lean organizations, which demonstrates a controversial position with high importance for acquisition strategy.
