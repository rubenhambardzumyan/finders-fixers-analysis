**Status**: ❌ FAILED  

### Feedback
Your expert list lacks critics who would challenge technology-first approaches to education or question digital learning effectiveness.


### Coaching
Add experts who advocate for traditional teaching methods or who question the effectiveness of AI-driven personalization in education.

## GEN-004 Assessment
**Status**: ❌ FAILED  

### Feedback
You're missing critical decision areas like curriculum design, assessment validity, and teacher training for digital learning integration.


### Coaching

## GEN-005 Assessment
**Status**: ❌ FAILED  

### Feedback
Your insights stay within the educational technology domain instead of learning from gaming, behavioral economics, or consumer app engagement.


### Coaching
Study how mobile games prevent abandonment and social media platforms maintain engagement to improve your learning app design.

**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Clear purpose statement exists focusing on global expertise in digital learning effectiveness.

## PUR-002 Assessment
**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: Purpose has clear focus on 2x academic growth with specific scope definition.

## PUR-003 Assessment
**Status**: ❌ FAILED  

### Feedback
You're missing critical decision areas like when to intervene versus when to let students struggle productively.


### Coaching
Add decision frameworks for intervention timing, difficulty progression, and personalization vs standardization choices.

## PUR-006 Assessment
**Status**: ❌ FAILED  

### Feedback
Your purpose lacks specific success metrics beyond "2x growth" and clear boundaries about which types of learning you'll focus on.


### Coaching
Add measurable outcomes: "Reduce test abandonment by X%, increase completion rates by Y%, achieve Z% of students reaching 2x growth targets."

**Result**: All Finder criteria passed: SPOVs address consequential topics like when to intervene before frustration thresholds and how to handle repeated failures.

## SPOV-008 Assessment
**Status**: ❌ FAILED  

### Feedback
You have strong behavioral intervention positions but missing stances on equally important areas like content design and assessment strategies.


### Coaching
Add clear positions on adaptive vs fixed content sequences, individual vs social learning experiences, and assessment frequency approaches.

## SPOV-009 Assessment
**Status**: ❌ FAILED  

### Feedback
Your SPOVs state intervention principles but don't provide decision frameworks for competing educational priorities.


### Coaching
Transform your "pivot teaching methods" SPOV into a decision tree that guides which alternative approach to use based on specific failure patterns.

## SPOV-010 Assessment
