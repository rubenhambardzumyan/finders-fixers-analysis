## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Problem Not Quantified

#### Feedback

The purpose mentions "ambiguity" and "rework" but provides no metrics. How much time is wasted on rework? What percentage of implementations fail due to poor planning? Without numbers, the problem's severity is unclear.

#### Coaching

Quantify the pain: "60% of implementation tasks require unplanned redesign, wasting 15 hours per sprint." Track these metrics before and after applying your SPOVs to prove value.

### Issue 2: Limited Scope Undermines Value

#### Feedback

Restricting to "Athena project" and excluding "team-wide practices" limits impact. If this only helps you personally, why create expertise rather than just improving your own process?

#### Coaching

Expand scope or abandon: Either make this applicable across teams (increasing value) or recognize this is a personal productivity hack, not expertise worth developing. Consider opportunity cost - what broader expertise could you build instead?

## Experts

### Issue 1: No Experts Listed

#### Feedback

The Experts section is empty with placeholder text. Without following domain experts in software design, agile planning, or documentation practices, you're missing proven patterns and alternative approaches.

#### Coaching

Add three expert categories: 1) Design methodology experts (Martin Fowler, Kent Beck), 2) Documentation advocates (Tom Preston-Werner, Joel Spolsky), 3) Agile planning critics who challenge your assumptions about upfront design.

## DOK1 Facts

### Manual Testing

### Issue 1: Missing External Sources

#### Feedback

The DOK1 facts list competencies from an internal spreadsheet without external validation. These aren't verifiable facts from industry sources, making them company-specific rather than universal expertise.

#### Coaching

Add external sources: "Manual testing in planning reduces implementation defects by 40% (Microsoft DevOps Report 2023)" or "Research shows 3:1 ROI on planning time (Standish Group Study)."

## DOK2 Summaries

### Multiple existing step types provide support

### Issue 1: Weak Synthesis

#### Feedback

"Multiple step types provide support" is a restatement of facts, not a synthesis explaining WHY certain activities require specific competencies or HOW they connect.

#### Coaching

Create meaningful synthesis: "Step types cluster into three patterns: exploration (research, reverse engineering), definition (APIs, models), and validation (testing, clarification) - each requiring different cognitive modes and time allocations."

## DOK3 Insights

### Having models in documents can be translated to code with AI

### Issue 1: Obvious Observation

#### Feedback

"AI can translate models to code" is widely known. This doesn't reveal surprising patterns or challenge assumptions about plan and design processes.

#### Coaching

Find the non-obvious: "AI translation works best when models are intentionally incomplete - 70% definition leaves room for implementation creativity while preventing major misalignment."

### Using time-based story points is an anti-pattern

### Issue 2: Assertion Without Pattern

#### Feedback

Calling time-based points an "anti-pattern" is an opinion, not an insight derived from observed patterns across multiple sources or experiences.

#### Coaching

Show the pattern: "Time-based estimation consistently undervalues complex planning by 50% because cognitive work doesn't scale linearly with time - 2 hours of design thinking ≠ 2 hours of coding."

## DOK4 SPOVs

### Plan and design output should update artifacts

### Issue 1: Not Controversial Enough

#### Feedback

"Update existing artifacts rather than create new documents" is accepted best practice in continuous documentation. Most teams would agree. This lacks spikiness.

#### Coaching

Make it spiky: "Never write a design document - only commit code stubs and failing tests as your plan. Documentation that isn't executable is waste." This forces readers to pick sides.

### Plan and design need to go further than ticket description

### Issue 2: Admitted as Common Sense

#### Feedback

You acknowledge this "may be general industry view" - if it's not controversial, it's not an SPOV. SPOVs must challenge conventional wisdom, not reinforce it.

#### Coaching

Flip the convention: "Ticket descriptions should be legally binding contracts - any deviation requires formal change request. This friction forces complete upfront thinking." Now that's spiky.

### Plan and design estimations must use predefined competency types

### Issue 3: Company-Specific Not Universal

#### Feedback

Using your company's specific competency system isn't a transferable SPOV. This is internal process optimization, not new knowledge about planning and design.

#### Coaching

Make it universal: "Planning work should be estimated in decision points, not time or complexity - each fork in design thinking costs equally regardless of implementation time."
