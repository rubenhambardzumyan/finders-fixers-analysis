## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Empty or Incomplete Purpose Statement

#### Feedback

The purpose statement lacks essential context about why package upgrade expertise matters now, what specific business problems it solves, and clear scope definition. The metrics mentioned (70% security reduction, 40% time decrease) are unsupported claims without methodology or baseline context.

#### Coaching

Start by answering: What critical package upgrade challenges is CloudFix facing that existing documentation can't solve? Define what types of packages (dependencies, infrastructure, security patches) and environments (production, staging, development) are in scope. Replace vague percentage goals with specific measurable outcomes like "reduce critical vulnerability exposure time from X days to Y days" with clear baseline measurements.

## Experts

### Issue 1: Missing Experts Section

#### Feedback

Without experts identified, there's no foundation for building domain knowledge or understanding different approaches to package upgrade strategies across different technology stacks and organizational contexts.

#### Coaching

Identify 3-5 experts who represent different schools of thought: security-first upgraders (focusing on vulnerability patches), stability-first maintainers (emphasizing gradual updates), and automation advocates (promoting continuous upgrade pipelines). Include experts from your tech stack, industry security researchers, and maintainers of critical dependencies CloudFix uses.

## DOK1 Facts

### Issue 1: Missing Knowledge Tree and Facts

#### Feedback

The Knowledge Tree doesn't contain any DOK1 Facts, leaving no foundation for understanding current package upgrade practices, common failure patterns, or evidence-based approaches to different upgrade scenarios.

#### Coaching

Start collecting specific facts about package upgrade challenges in your environment. What percentage of security vulnerabilities come from outdated packages? Which types of updates (major, minor, patch) cause the most production issues? Document specific examples of upgrade failures, their root causes, and resolution approaches. Focus on verifiable data rather than assumptions.

## DOK2 Summaries

### Issue 1: Missing Summaries

#### Feedback

Without DOK2 Summaries, there's no synthesis of how different upgrade strategies work together or logical connections between various approaches and their outcomes in different contexts.

#### Coaching

Once you have facts, synthesize them into patterns: "Security patches require immediate deployment but major version upgrades need extensive testing cycles." Connect upgrade timing, risk assessment, and rollback strategies into coherent explanations of how successful package management works across different scenarios.

## DOK3 Insights

### Issue 1: Missing Strategic Analysis

#### Feedback

The BrainLift lacks DOK3 Insights, missing the strategic thinking needed to understand surprising patterns across multiple sources and derive practical rules for package upgrade decision-making.

#### Coaching

After building your knowledge base, look for counterintuitive patterns: When do slower upgrade cycles actually reduce security risk? How do different team structures (centralized vs distributed) affect upgrade success rates? Develop practical rules like "Critical security updates require different validation processes than feature updates" based on evidence from your sources.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### Issue 1: Missing Spiky Points of View

#### Feedback

Without SPOVs, this BrainLift provides no decision-making framework for controversial package upgrade choices that CloudFix teams face in real situations.

#### Coaching

Develop actionable stances that guide decisions: "We prioritize automated security patches over manual approval workflows" or "We maintain one major version behind latest for stability over cutting-edge features." These should be debatable positions that force teams to choose sides and directly influence how CloudFix handles package upgrades in production.
