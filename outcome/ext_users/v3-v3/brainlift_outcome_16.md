## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Vague Problem Definition

#### Feedback

The purpose states "help Trilogy make the best Product and Technology decisions" but doesn't identify the specific problem being solved. What failures occur without this expertise? What metrics are broken?

#### Coaching

Reframe around a measurable problem: "Khoros loses 30% of customers during platform migration because we lack unified engagement strategy." Add metrics like customer retention rate, migration time, and revenue impact to justify this BrainLift.

### Issue 2: Missing Business Impact Metrics

#### Feedback

"Understanding what drives customer value" and "healthy architecture" are concepts, not measurable outcomes. Without specific metrics, you can't validate if your expertise delivers value.

#### Coaching

Define three metrics: 1) Reduce customer churn during migration from X% to Y%, 2) Cut platform fragmentation costs by $Z, 3) Increase cross-product adoption by N%. Track these monthly to prove your SPOVs work.

## Experts

### James Dodkins

### Issue 1: Insufficient Expert Details

#### Feedback

The expert entry only mentions title and link without explaining his views on customer experience, what you agree/disagree with, or why he's relevant to Khoros's social engagement challenges.

#### Coaching

Expand with specifics: "Dodkins advocates for unified customer journeys (agree) but dismisses AI automation potential (disagree - our data shows 40% deflection possible)." Show critical engagement, not just following.

### Issue 2: Single Expert Echo Chamber

#### Feedback

Having only one expert creates an echo chamber. Where are the social platform architects, AI integration specialists, or competitors' viewpoints that would challenge your assumptions?

#### Coaching

Add three expert categories: 1) Platform competitors (Sprinklr, Hootsuite leaders), 2) AI orchestration experts, 3) Enterprise architecture critics. Diverse views will sharpen your SPOVs about platform unification.

## DOK1 Facts

### Lambda /var/task is read-only

### Issue 1: Missing Source Attribution

#### Feedback

All DOK1 facts lack external source attribution. These appear to be internal observations rather than verifiable facts from documentation, making them impossible to validate or update.

#### Coaching

Add sources: "X (Twitter): Full OAuth integration (Khoros API Documentation v2.3)" or "Lambda timeout: 15 minutes (AWS Lambda Limits, 2024)." This attribution ensures facts remain current and verifiable.

## DOK2 Summaries

### Publishing platforms integrations

### Issue 1: List Without Synthesis

#### Feedback

The DOK2 section lists integration statuses but doesn't synthesize WHY certain platforms have full support while others don't, or HOW this pattern affects customer value.

#### Coaching

Create synthesis: "Full integrations correlate with 80% of customer engagement volume (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), while partial integrations represent emerging channels with <5% volume but high growth potential."

## DOK3 Insights

### Spredfast has been in maintenance mode

### Issue 1: Observation Not Insight

#### Feedback

"Spredfast in maintenance mode" is a fact, not an insight. It doesn't reveal surprising patterns or provide actionable rules of thumb for decision-making.

#### Coaching

Transform to insight: "Products in maintenance mode paradoxically generate more profit than active development - zero dev cost with steady revenue creates 70% margins that fund new platform development."

### Khoros Care orchestrates high-volume interactions

### Issue 2: Obvious Statement

#### Feedback

That a care platform "orchestrates interactions" is its basic function, not a surprising insight. This doesn't challenge assumptions or reveal hidden patterns.

#### Coaching

Find the non-obvious: "Care's air traffic control pattern works because agent context-switching follows predictable 7-minute cycles - design around this rhythm, not arbitrary efficiency metrics."

## DOK4 SPOVs

### AI-powered publishing is now just cost of entry

### Issue 1: Industry Consensus Not SPOV

#### Feedback

"AI is table stakes" is widely accepted in social marketing. Any vendor would agree. This lacks the controversial edge needed for a true SPOV.

#### Coaching

Make it spiky: "AI should handle 90% of social publishing with zero human review - brands obsessing over perfect AI responses miss that customers prefer fast, slightly-wrong responses to slow, perfect ones."

### Pricing should penalize platform fragmentation

### Issue 2: Good But Not Grounded

#### Feedback

This SPOV about pricing strategy doesn't reference your DOK3 insights. Without grounding in patterns you've observed, it's an opinion rather than expertise-based conviction.

#### Coaching

Connect to insights: "Based on my insight that fragmented customers cost 3x more to support, charge 50% premium for partial implementations - make unified adoption the only rational economic choice."

### AI will convert care into workflows orchestrator

### Issue 3: Prediction Without Evidence

#### Feedback

"AI will convert care" is future speculation without current evidence or actionable guidance. How does this SPOV change decisions today?

#### Coaching

Make it actionable now: "Design every care feature assuming 80% AI handling within 18 months - build escalation paths today, not agent productivity tools that become obsolete."
