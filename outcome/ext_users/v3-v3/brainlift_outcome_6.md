## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Missing Background Context

#### Feedback

The Purpose Statement lacks background and context about the problem. It doesn't explain why domain-based calendar invite filtering is important to solve, what business or technical variables will be maximized, or what impact the current lack of filtering has on the organization.

#### Coaching

Replace 'Build expertise' with the actual business problem: what security risks or productivity losses occur without domain filtering? State the specific variables you'll maximize (e.g., 'reduce spam calendar invites by 80%' or 'eliminate security incidents from untrusted domains').

### Issue 2: Unclear Problem Definition

#### Feedback

The Purpose Statement doesn't clearly articulate the specific problem being solved. While it mentions implementing 'domain-based filtering system,' it doesn't explain what problem this addresses (e.g., security risks from untrusted domains, spam calendar invites, user productivity issues).

#### Coaching

Start your Purpose Statement with the specific problem this solves: 'Users receive malicious calendar invites from external domains that compromise security' or 'Spam calendar invites reduce productivity by X hours per week.' Then connect the filtering system as the solution to this defined problem.

### Issue 3: Missing Measurable Outcomes

#### Feedback

The Purpose Statement lacks clear, measurable outcomes with specific metrics. It focuses on building 'expertise' and 'understanding' rather than defining business-related metrics like reduction in spam calendar invites, improved security posture, or enhanced user productivity.

#### Coaching

Replace 'understanding data flows' with measurable business outcomes like 'implement filtering that blocks 95% of external spam invites while maintaining 100% delivery of legitimate meeting requests.' Focus on what changes in your organization, not what you'll learn.

### Issue 4: Missing Scope Definition

#### Feedback

The Purpose Statement doesn't define what's in scope and out of scope for this BrainLift. While it mentions 'without disrupting existing functionality,' it doesn't clearly delineate the boundaries of the domain being addressed.

#### Coaching

Add explicit scope boundaries: 'In scope: calendar invite filtering for Exchange/Outlook integration. Out of scope: email filtering, mobile app modifications, or third-party calendar systems.' This prevents scope creep and focuses your expertise development.

### Issue 5: Vague Mission Statement

#### Feedback

The Purpose Statement reads more like a vague mission statement focused on knowledge acquisition rather than solving a specific business problem. It emphasizes 'building expertise' and 'understanding' without connecting these activities to concrete business outcomes or organizational impact.

#### Coaching

Rewrite to solve a real problem: 'Implement domain-based calendar filtering to eliminate security incidents from malicious external invites affecting 500+ users daily.' The expertise you build should serve this specific business outcome, not be the goal itself.

## Experts

### Aadit Sheth

#### Issue 1: Missing Critical Info

#### Feedback

Missing occupation details. While mentioned as CEO of NeatPrompts, there's no clear connection between NeatPrompts (AI adoption for enterprises) and Calendar Data Flow expertise in Kerio Connect, which creates a relevance gap.

#### Coaching

For Aadit Sheth, you need to either: 1) Research and document his specific technical background with email systems, calendar protocols, or C++ development that connects to Kerio Connect, or 2) Replace him with an expert who has demonstrated expertise in mail server architecture, calendar synchronization protocols (CalDAV, Exchange), or enterprise email system development. Your expert selection must show clear domain alignment - AI expertise alone doesn't qualify someone as a calendar data flow expert.

#### Issue 2: Missing Main Views

#### Feedback

No 'Main Views' section explaining Aadit's specific SPOVs related to calendar data flows in email systems or Kerio Connect architecture.

#### Coaching

Add a 'Main Views' section for Aadit that captures his specific perspectives on: calendar data processing pipelines, API contract design for calendar systems, or performance optimization in mail servers. If you cannot find his published views on these topics, this confirms he may not be the right expert for your Kerio Connect calendar filtering BrainLift.

#### Issue 3: Missing Why Follow

#### Feedback

No 'Why Follow' section explaining why following Aadit would help the BrainLift creator become an expert in Kerio Connect calendar filtering systems.

#### Coaching

Create a 'Why Follow Aadit Sheth' section that specifically explains how his expertise will advance your understanding of Kerio Connect's calendar architecture. Focus on: What unique insights does he provide about calendar data flows? What specific technical approaches does he advocate? How will following his work make you better at implementing calendar filtering systems?

#### Issue 4: Missing Agreement/Disagreement

#### Feedback

No explicit notes about what the BrainLift creator agrees with AND disagrees with regarding Aadit's views on calendar data flows.

#### Coaching

Document both your agreements and disagreements with Aadit's technical approaches to calendar systems. For example: 'I agree with Aadit's emphasis on API-first design for calendar interfaces, but disagree with his preference for REST over native calendar protocols like CalDAV for enterprise integrations.' This critical analysis demonstrates deep engagement with his expertise.

#### Issue 5: Missing Attribution

#### Feedback

No proper attribution with links/URLs to find Aadit online, only a partial Twitter handle (@aaditsh).

#### Coaching

Provide complete attribution for Aadit Sheth: full Twitter handle, LinkedIn profile, company website (NeatPrompts), and any technical blogs or publications. Include direct links to his content about calendar systems, API design, or email architecture. If you can't find substantial technical content from him on these topics, reconsider his inclusion.

#### Issue 6: Domain Mismatch

#### Feedback

There's a disconnect between Aadit's described expertise (AI adoption, writing about AI tools) and the technical domain expertise needed (Kerio Connect calendar architecture, mail processing pipelines, C++ development).

#### Coaching

Replace Aadit Sheth with an expert who has direct experience in: email server development, calendar protocol implementation, or enterprise mail system architecture. Look for experts who have worked on Exchange Server, Zimbra, or similar mail platforms. Domain alignment is non-negotiable - your experts must have demonstrable expertise in the specific technical area of your BrainLift.

### Shubham Saboo

#### Issue 1: Missing Occupation Clarity

#### Feedback

While described as an author of books on GPT-3 & Neural Search, there's no clear connection between LLMs/RAG expertise and calendar identification/API contracts in email server systems.

#### Coaching

For Shubham Saboo, you must establish a clear connection between his expertise and Kerio Connect calendar systems. Either: 1) Research his background in API design, system architecture, or data processing that applies to calendar systems, or 2) Replace him with an expert in email protocols, calendar synchronization, or enterprise messaging systems. Book authorship on AI topics doesn't qualify someone as a calendar API expert.

#### Issue 2: Missing Main Views

#### Feedback

No 'Main Views' section explaining Shubham's specific SPOVs related to calendar identification and API contracts in email systems.

#### Coaching

Add a 'Main Views' section documenting Shubham's perspectives on: API contract design, data identification patterns in complex systems, or system integration approaches that apply to calendar processing. If his published work doesn't cover these areas, he's not the right expert for your Kerio Connect BrainLift.

#### Issue 3: Missing Why Follow

#### Feedback

No 'Why Follow' section explaining why following Shubham would contribute to becoming an expert in Kerio Connect's calendar API architecture.

#### Coaching

Create a 'Why Follow Shubham Saboo' section that explains his specific value for calendar API expertise. Address: What unique approaches does he bring to API design? How do his data processing insights apply to calendar identification? What specific methodologies will help you implement better calendar filtering in Kerio Connect?

#### Issue 4: Missing Agreement/Disagreement

#### Feedback

No explicit notes about what the BrainLift creator agrees with AND disagrees with regarding Shubham's perspectives on calendar API design.

#### Coaching

Document your critical analysis of Shubham's technical approaches. For example: 'I agree with Shubham's emphasis on schema-first API design but disagree with his preference for GraphQL over REST for calendar data queries in enterprise environments.' This shows you're actively engaging with and evaluating his expertise, not just citing him.

#### Issue 5: Missing Attribution

#### Feedback

No proper attribution with links/URLs to find Shubham online, only a partial Twitter handle (@Saboo*Shubham*).

#### Coaching

Provide complete attribution for Shubham Saboo: correct Twitter handle, LinkedIn profile, Medium articles, GitHub repositories, and published books with direct links. Most importantly, link to his technical content that relates to API design, system architecture, or data processing patterns that apply to your calendar filtering work.

#### Issue 6: Domain Mismatch

#### Feedback

Similar to Aadit, there's a mismatch between Shubham's AI/ML expertise and the needed technical expertise in email server architecture, calendar protocols, and C++ system development.

#### Coaching

Replace Shubham Saboo with an expert who has hands-on experience with: email server development, calendar protocol standards (RFC 5545, CalDAV, CardDAV), or enterprise messaging platform architecture. Consider experts from Microsoft Exchange team, Google Workspace calendar team, or open-source mail server projects. Your expert selection must demonstrate clear technical relevance to Kerio Connect's calendar filtering challenges.

## DOK1 Facts

### No DOK1 Facts found in Knowledge Tree

#### Issue 1: Missing Fact Extraction

#### Feedback

Your Knowledge Tree currently only contains source references without extracting the actual factual information from those sources. This creates a gap between your sources and your higher-level thinking.

#### Coaching

Start by going through each source file you've listed and extract 3-5 specific, verifiable facts from each one. For example, from your Content.idl file, extract facts like 'Content.idl defines 15 RPC methods for calendar operations' or 'The ContentAdapter class inherits from BaseRPCAdapter'. Each fact should be attributable to its specific source and represent concrete information that can be verified by reading that source.

## DOK2 Summaries

### No DOK2 Summaries found in Knowledge Tree

#### Issue 1: Missing Source Synthesis

#### Feedback

While you've organized sources by architectural layers, you haven't synthesized the key concepts from each source into coherent explanations. This leaves a gap between raw facts and insights.

#### Coaching

After extracting DOK1 facts, create summaries that explain how multiple facts from the same source connect together. For instance, if your Content.idl file contains facts about RPC methods, adapter inheritance, and calendar operations, your DOK2 summary should explain how these facts work together to enable calendar filtering functionality. Focus on the 'how' and 'why' within each source - show the logical flow and causality between the facts you've extracted.

## DOK3 Insights

### Content.idl Insight

#### Issue 1: Lacks Strategic Value

#### Feedback

This reads more like technical documentation than a strategic insight. While accurate, it doesn't reveal surprising patterns or provide actionable rules for decision-making.

#### Coaching

Transform this into a strategic insight by focusing on the surprising or counter-intuitive pattern. For example: 'In Kerio Connect, UI functionality is completely dependent on build-time code generation - this means any frontend feature additions require backend build pipeline changes, making rapid UI prototyping impossible without full system rebuilds. This architectural constraint should drive a 'backend-first' development approach for calendar filtering features.' This version reveals a surprising constraint and provides strategic guidance.

### Right Directory Insight

#### Issue 1: Missing Architectural Pattern

#### Feedback

This insight provides practical guidance but doesn't reveal the deeper architectural pattern. It's more of a learned lesson than a strategic insight that transcends multiple sources.

#### Coaching

Elevate this to reveal the underlying architectural principle. For example: 'Kerio Connect enforces strict architectural boundaries through directory structure and build configuration - violating these boundaries creates runtime dependency conflicts that are nearly impossible to debug. This suggests that in legacy email systems, architectural compliance is more critical than code functionality - a working feature in the wrong layer will fail in production, while a simple feature in the correct layer will be stable.' This version reveals a broader pattern about legacy system architecture that can guide multiple decisions.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### No SPOVs found - section contains technical implementation details instead of controversial, actionable decision rules

#### Issue 1: Missing Decision Framework

#### Feedback

Your DOK4 section currently contains technical implementation details rather than controversial, actionable decision rules. SPOVs should be debatable positions that guide your approach to solving the calendar filtering problem.

#### Coaching

Based on your insights about directory placement and IDL dependencies, craft controversial positions about your approach. For example: 'We believe calendar filtering should be implemented at the mail pipeline level rather than at the UI level, even if this requires more complex backend changes, because Kerio Connect's architecture makes UI-driven filtering brittle and maintenance-heavy.' Or: 'We prioritize architectural compliance over feature velocity - it's better to spend extra time placing code in the correct directory structure than to implement quickly in the wrong location.' These positions should be debatable and guide specific decisions you'll make while implementing the calendar filtering solution.
