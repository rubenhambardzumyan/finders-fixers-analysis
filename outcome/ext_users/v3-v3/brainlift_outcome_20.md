## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Missing Business Impact Metrics

#### Feedback

Your purpose mentions acquiring 500 users but doesn't explain WHY this matters to the business or what specific variables will be maximized beyond user count. Without clear business metrics, it's difficult to justify the investment in building this expertise.

#### Coaching

Add specific business metrics that 500 active users will impact. Example: "500 active users will reduce average BrainLift creation time by 40%, saving 200 engineer-hours monthly, resulting in $80K/month productivity gains."

### Issue 2: Undefined Scope Boundaries

#### Feedback

Your purpose doesn't define what's in-scope vs out-of-scope for this adoption strategy expertise. This lack of boundaries makes it unclear whether you're building expertise for internal Trilogy adoption or broader market strategy.

#### Coaching

Define clear boundaries: "IN SCOPE: Trilogy internal adoption, engineer/PM personas, onboarding optimization. OUT OF SCOPE: External customers, non-technical users, pricing strategy, marketing campaigns."

## Experts

### Dave Snowden

### Issue 1: Incomplete "Why Follow" Section

#### Feedback

Dave Snowden's "Why follow" section is completely empty, providing no justification for including this expert in your BrainLift about adoption strategy.

#### Coaching

Complete with: "Follow because his Cynefin framework helps identify when BrainLifts (complex domain) vs documentation (complicated domain) is appropriate - critical for adoption messaging to different user segments."

### Issue 2: Missing Agree/Disagree Notes

#### Feedback

No explicit notes on what you agree or disagree with regarding Dave Snowden's views on knowledge management, making it unclear how his expertise shapes your approach.

#### Coaching

Add: "AGREE: Adaptive knowledge approaches for complex problems. DISAGREE: His view that all structured frameworks limit emergence - BrainLifts balance structure with adaptability."

### Samuel Hulick

### Issue 1: Missing Where to Find Link

#### Feedback

Samuel Hulick's X (Twitter) link is mentioned but not provided, making it difficult to follow this expert's ongoing insights.

#### Coaching

Add the actual link: "Where to find: [Samuel Hulick X](https://x.com/samuelhulick)"

### Clayton Christensen

### Issue 1: Empty "Where to Find" Field

#### Feedback

Clayton Christensen's "Where to find" field is completely empty, limiting ability to access his work and ideas.

#### Coaching

Since Christensen passed away in 2020, reference: "Books: 'Innovator's Dilemma', 'Jobs to Be Done Theory'. Modern practitioners: Bob Moesta (jobstobedone.org), Karen Dillon."

## DOK1 Facts

### "Being consistent is not the same as being perfect"

### Issue 1: Missing Source Attribution

#### Feedback

This fact lacks proper source attribution, making it impossible to verify or explore the context further.

#### Coaching

Add source: "From James Clear's article 'Forget About Setting Goals' [link]: 'Being consistent is not the same as being perfect' - applies to daily BrainLift habit formation."

### Empty DOK1 Fact Entry

### Issue 1: Incomplete Fact

#### Feedback

The second DOK1 fact under "Being Consistent" section is completely empty, leaving a gap in your knowledge foundation.

#### Coaching

Complete with a relevant fact from the source, e.g., "Missing two days in a row starts a new negative habit cycle (Clear, 2019) - critical for maintaining daily BrainLift engagement."

### Incomplete DOK1 Fact in Good Strategy

### Issue 1: Truncated Fact

#### Feedback

The second fact under "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy" is incomplete: "A good adoption strategy establishes a clear diagnosis that identifies the core challenge (such as specific adoption barriers), a guiding policy." - sentence cuts off mid-thought.

#### Coaching

Complete the fact: "A good adoption strategy establishes a clear diagnosis, a guiding policy that addresses the challenge, and coherent actions that implement the policy (Rumelt, 2011)."

## DOK2 Summaries

### Summary 2.3: Onboarding Process

### Issue 1: Weak Connection Between Facts and Summary

#### Feedback

Your summary about friction-free onboarding isn't clearly derived from the generic facts listed below it. The logical chain from facts to summary is missing.

#### Coaching

Strengthen the connection: "BECAUSE terminology confusion increases churn (Fact 2) AND step-by-step workflows reduce it (Fact 3), BLCoach must introduce one DOK level at a time with immediate wins at each stage."

### Summary 2.1: Product Adoption Strategy

### Issue 1: Too Generic for BrainLift Context

#### Feedback

This summary about product adoption strategy could apply to any product - it lacks BrainLift-specific application and insights.

#### Coaching

Make it BrainLift-specific: "BrainLift adoption strategy must manage the trade-off between comprehensive expertise development (slow) and quick wins (fast) by starting with narrow, high-impact SPOVs."

## DOK3 Insights

### Insight 3.1: User journey metrics

### Issue 1: Generic Product Management Insight

#### Feedback

This insight about user journeys and metrics could apply to any product - it doesn't capture patterns specific to BrainLift adoption or knowledge management tools.

#### Coaching

Make specific to BrainLifts: "BrainLift adoption uniquely stalls at DOK3 insight creation (60% drop-off) because users can collect facts but struggle to synthesize patterns - focus coaching interventions there."

### Insight 3.2: Limiting initial users

### Issue 1: Missing Pattern Synthesis

#### Feedback

This insight about limiting users is stated as a single principle rather than a pattern derived from multiple sources in your Knowledge Tree.

#### Coaching

Connect to multiple sources: "Combining Clear's habit formation with Christensen's disruption theory shows: start with 10 power users who achieve mastery before expanding, creating social proof that overcomes resistance."

## DOK4 SPOVs

### SPOV 4.1: Software companies...doomed to extinction

### Issue 1: Not Grounded in DOK3 Insights

#### Feedback

This dramatic SPOV about traditional knowledge management being fatal isn't clearly connected to your three DOK3 insights about adoption journeys, user limits, and feedback mechanisms.

#### Coaching

Ground in your insights: "BECAUSE adoption requires clear metrics (3.1) and controlled rollout (3.2), companies using wikis fail by lacking feedback loops (3.3) that signal expertise development."

### Issue 2: Not Actionable Enough

#### Feedback

"Doomed to extinction" is dramatic but doesn't guide specific decisions about how to run the BLCoach adoption strategy differently.

#### Coaching

Reframe as actionable rule: "We reject any adoption tactic that doesn't force daily BrainLift edits. Every feature must drive daily engagement or gets cut - passive documentation equals death."

### SPOV 4.2: Power users before broad rollout

### Issue 1: Insufficient Controversy

#### Feedback

Starting with power users before broad rollout is a fairly accepted product adoption practice, not a controversial stance that forces readers to pick a side.

#### Coaching

Make it more controversial: "We will actively PREVENT eager users from accessing BLCoach until our first 10 users demonstrate expertise gains - enthusiasm without results destroys credibility permanently."

### SPOV 4.3: Emotional barriers over features

### Issue 1: Missing Clear Decision Rule

#### Feedback

While this SPOV correctly identifies emotional barriers, it doesn't provide a clear decision rule for what to do differently in the adoption strategy.

#### Coaching

Add clear decision: "Every onboarding step must make users feel smart, not educated. We measure 'confidence score' not 'feature usage' - if confidence drops below 7/10, we redesign immediately."

## Knowledge Tree

### Issue 1: Empty Knowledge Areas

#### Feedback

Your Knowledge Tree has two empty knowledge areas (User Journey Design and Feedback Mechanisms) with no sources or facts, leaving significant gaps in your expertise foundation.

#### Coaching

Either populate these areas with relevant sources or remove them. For User Journey Design, add sources on habit loops, activation metrics, and behavioral psychology specific to knowledge tools.

### Issue 2: Sparse Source Coverage

#### Feedback

Most knowledge areas have only 1-2 sources, insufficient for developing expertise. Product Adoption Strategy particularly needs more diverse perspectives.

#### Coaching

Add 3-5 more sources per area. For Product Adoption, include: "Crossing the Chasm" (Moore), "Hooked" (Eyal), "The Lean Startup" (Ries), each with specific BrainLift adoption applications.
