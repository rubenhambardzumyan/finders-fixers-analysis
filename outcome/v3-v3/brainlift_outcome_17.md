## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Purpose Statement Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a Purpose Statement entirely, making it impossible to understand what problem this expertise solves or why it's needed. Without clear purpose, stakeholders can't determine when to apply this knowledge.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 110: Pick the BrainLift You Need to Create](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Add comprehensive purpose: Define what backlog pruning problems you're solving, why this expertise is critical during import quarters, and what outcomes indicate success. Explain the business impact of effective vs ineffective backlog management.

### Issue 2: Ownership Unclear

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift shows "Owner:" with no name, creating accountability gaps and making it unclear who maintains and evolves this expertise.

#### Coaching

Assign clear ownership: Specify the TPM, engineering leader, or import team member responsible for this expertise. This ensures maintenance and provides stakeholders with a knowledge source.

## Experts

### Expert Network Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift has no experts section, missing opportunities to ground your approach in broader industry experience with backlog management, technical debt reduction, or acquisition integration practices.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 121: Building Your Expert Network](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Add relevant experts: Include product management authorities, technical debt specialists, acquisition integration experts, and agile methodology practitioners who can validate your backlog pruning approaches.

## DOK1 Facts

### Factual Foundation Absent

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks DOK1 facts, providing no evidence base for your strategic decisions. Without supporting data, your insights and SPOVs can't be validated or improved.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Document key facts: Add statistics about typical backlog sizes at acquisition, success rates of different pruning strategies, cost savings from effective backlog management, and time allocation data for import quarters.

## DOK2 Facts

### Synthesis Framework Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks DOK2 summaries that would synthesize backlog management patterns into coherent frameworks. Without this synthesis, teams can't understand how individual facts connect to create actionable strategies.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Create synthesis summaries: Develop frameworks that connect backlog analysis, prioritization criteria, pruning decisions, and execution strategies into coherent implementation guidance.

## DOK3 Insight

### Strategic Insights Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift shows no DOK3 insights, missing the cross-pattern analysis that would reveal counterintuitive findings about backlog management during acquisitions. Without insights, teams lack strategic guidance.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 200: Deriving DOK3 Insights from Patterns](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Develop strategic insights: Analyze patterns across multiple imports to identify what backlog pruning approaches work best in different scenarios, what common assumptions are wrong, and what early indicators predict pruning success.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### AWS Vendor Lock-in Advantage

#### Feedback

Your single SPOV about AWS vendor lock-in being "a big advantage" is underdeveloped and doesn't connect clearly to backlog pruning decisions. This SPOV needs more context and supporting rationale.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Expand and connect SPOVs: Explain how AWS lock-in specifically enables better backlog pruning decisions, what alternatives you're rejecting, and how this philosophical stance guides day-to-day import quarter choices.
