## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Ambitious Vision Needs Quantification

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement about becoming "the global expert" and "revolutionizing digital education for millions" is aspirational but lacks specific metrics for measuring progress toward these goals. How will you know when you've achieved thought leadership status?

#### Coaching

Add measurable milestones: "Achieve 10,000 app downloads, 85% user retention rate, and 2x learning speed improvements within 18 months." Connect the vision to specific, trackable outcomes.

## Experts

### Strong Academic Foundation

#### Feedback

Your expert selection (Justin Skycak, Dr. Ryan Baker, Dr. Sidney D'Mello) provides excellent academic credibility with practical implementation experience. The balance between research and application is well-constructed.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 121: Building Your Expert Network](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

No issues found! Your experts combine rigorous research backgrounds with practical app development experience, providing both theoretical foundation and implementation guidance.

## DOK1 Facts

### Evidence Sources Need Documentation

#### Feedback

Your insights reference specific thresholds (2-3 consecutive wrong answers, 95% accuracy gates, 40 CQPM targets) but don't cite the research studies that established these numbers. These specific metrics need academic backing.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Add research citations: Reference the specific studies that established each threshold. "Bloom's 2-sigma problem research", "Math Academy internal data", etc. This transforms claims into validated facts.

## DOK2 Facts

### Learning Behavior Hierarchy

#### Feedback

Your DOK2 summary about the hierarchy of harmful behaviors (boredom > gaming > confusion) effectively prioritizes intervention strategies and provides clear design guidance for learning apps.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

No issues found! This hierarchy provides actionable prioritization for app development resources and intervention system design.

## DOK3 Insight

### Intervention Timing Critical

#### Feedback

Your insights about intervening before frustration thresholds and pivoting teaching methods demonstrate sophisticated understanding of learning psychology and provide specific implementation guidance.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 200: Deriving DOK3 Insights from Patterns](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

No issues found! These insights bridge educational research with practical app design, showing exactly how to implement research-backed interventions.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### Frustration Threshold Intervention

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about intervening "BEFORE students reach their frustration threshold" with the specific "2-3 consecutive wrong answers" metric provides clear, actionable guidance that challenges conventional after-the-fact remediation approaches.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

No issues found! This SPOV provides specific implementation criteria while challenging the common practice of waiting for students to fail before intervening.

### Teaching Method Pivoting

#### Feedback

Your SPOV that failure often indicates teaching method problems rather than comprehension difficulty is insightful and provides clear guidance for adaptive learning systems.

#### Coaching

Add specific pivot criteria: Define what constitutes "different instructional approaches" and when to trigger method changes. This makes the SPOV more immediately implementable.
