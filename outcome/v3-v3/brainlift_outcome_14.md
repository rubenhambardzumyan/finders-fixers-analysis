## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Complex Technical Focus vs Business Impact

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement provides excellent technical detail about feedback collection mechanisms but could better emphasize the business impact. "Improve overall hire quality" is the key outcome, but it gets buried in technical implementation details.

#### Coaching

Lead with business value: "Reduce hiring pipeline failure rates by 40% through systematic feedback analysis that identifies R2 gaps." Put the measurable business outcome first, then explain the technical approach.

### Issue 2: Success Metrics Well-Defined

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement implies specific success metrics through the self-learning system concept, though explicit targets would strengthen accountability. The focus on "surgical improvements rather than system overhauls" provides good strategic guidance.

## DOK4 SPOVs
