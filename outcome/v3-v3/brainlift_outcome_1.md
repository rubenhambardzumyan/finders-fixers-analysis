## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Scope Definition Needs Clarification

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement mentions "lower left quadrant MarTech companies" but doesn't clearly define what specific characteristics make a company fall into this category. The scope boundaries between what's included vs excluded in this BrainLift domain need to be more explicit.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 110: Pick the BrainLift You Need to Create](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Define your scope with a simple inclusion/exclusion list. List 3-5 specific criteria that make a MarTech company "lower left quadrant" (e.g., <$50M ARR, >60% SMB customers, monthly billing dominant). Then state what you're explicitly NOT covering (enterprise MarTech, annual contract dominant companies, etc.).

### Issue 2: Business Impact Justification

#### Feedback

While you mention specific metrics (75% margin, 90%+ NDR), the Purpose Statement could better explain why solving this specific problem is critical right now. What market dynamics or business pressures make this expertise essential today?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 110: Pick the BrainLift You Need to Create](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Add 2-3 sentences about the "why now" - what's changed in the MarTech/SMB landscape that makes traditional ESW playbooks insufficient? This creates urgency and helps justify the effort investment in building this expertise.

## Experts

### Patrick Campbell

#### Issue 1: Limited Viewpoint Analysis

#### Feedback

While you mention Patrick Campbell's credentials and data analysis experience, you don't specify what he agrees/disagrees with regarding your BrainLift's approach. Understanding his specific stance on SMB MarTech pricing strategies would make this expert reference more actionable.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 121: Building Your Expert Network](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Add a "Main Views" section stating Campbell's specific positions on SMB pricing strategies, and explicitly note where you agree vs disagree with his approaches. This prevents echo chamber thinking and strengthens your own SPOVs.

### Elena Verna

#### Issue 1: Expert Relevance Connection

#### Feedback

Elena Verna is listed for her growth expertise, but the connection between her product-led growth focus and your specific MarTech SMB acquisition challenges could be stronger. How does her methodology apply to your monthly-contract, low-stickiness customer base?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 121: Building Your Expert Network](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Clarify why Verna's PLG frameworks are relevant for your specific use case. Does her approach work for monthly SMB customers, or do you need to adapt it? Be explicit about what you'll adopt vs modify from her playbook.

## DOK1 Facts

### Pricing Data Sources

#### Issue 1: Attribution and Verification

#### Feedback

Several facts reference studies and benchmarks (like "26% higher gross retention rates") but lack proper source attribution and dates. This makes it difficult to verify the claims and assess their current relevance to your MarTech SMB context.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

For each statistic, include the source, publication date, and sample size. Add a brief note on why this data is relevant to your specific MarTech SMB context. This transforms generic facts into actionable intelligence.

## DOK2 Facts

### Customer Success Strategies

#### Issue 1: Source Summary Coherence

#### Feedback

Your DOK2 summaries jump between different concepts (premium success services, usage pricing, product data analysis) without clear logical connections. Each summary should synthesize facts from a single source into a coherent explanation.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Restructure each DOK2 summary to focus on one source at a time. Show the logical chain: "Source X demonstrates that when companies do Y, they achieve Z outcome because of these specific factors." This makes the summaries actually useful for decision-making.

## DOK3 Insight

### AI Monetization Timing

#### Issue 1: Cross-Source Pattern Recognition

#### Feedback

Your insight about monetizing AI "aggressively in the first 1-2 years" draws from limited sources and doesn't demonstrate synthesis across multiple expert perspectives. The pattern isn't clearly established across different contexts.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 200: Deriving DOK3 Insights from Patterns](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Support this insight with data from at least 3 different sources showing similar timing patterns. What specific market indicators suggest the 1-2 year window? This transforms opinion into actionable intelligence.

### Hybrid Pricing Safety

#### Issue 1: Surprising Pattern Identification

#### Feedback

The insight about "hybrid embedded-premium pricing" being the "safest way" to raise prices needs more controversial edge. What counterintuitive finding led to this conclusion? What would most people expect instead?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 200: Deriving DOK3 Insights from Patterns](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Sharpen this insight by contrasting it with conventional wisdom. Most people think X about pricing increases, but your analysis shows Y is actually safer because Z. This makes the insight memorable and actionable.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### AI-First Hiring Position

#### Issue 1: Actionable Decision Rules

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about replacing "every legacy team member" with "AI-first hires" is provocative but lacks specific decision criteria. When exactly should you make this replacement? What defines an "AI-first hire"?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Convert this into an actionable rule: "Replace any role that hasn't automated 40%+ of routine tasks within 6 months with an AI-first hire who can demonstrate automation of similar tasks." Give specific criteria for implementation decisions.

### Outcome-Based AI Pricing

#### Issue 1: Grounding in Insights

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about "relentlessly pursuing outcome-metered AI features" needs stronger connection to your DOK3 insights. Which specific insights support this aggressive pursuit? How do they combine to justify this stance?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Reference 2-3 specific insights that led to this SPOV. For example: "Because insight X shows timing pressure and insight Y demonstrates value correlation, we must..." This grounds your position in evidence rather than opinion.
