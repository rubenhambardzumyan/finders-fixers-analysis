Add industry experts: Include enterprise software operations specialists, cloud migration authorities, acquisition integration experts, and AWS optimization practitioners who can provide external validation.

## DOK1 Facts

### AWS-First Strategy Documented

#### Feedback

Your facts about being "AWS first" and frequently buying "poorly managed or bankrupt" companies provide clear strategic context. The definitive stance that "AWS does not fail" is bold and operationally significant.

#### Coaching

No issues found! These facts provide clear strategic foundation and operational philosophy that teams can immediately apply to infrastructure decisions.

## DOK2 Facts

### Synthesis Framework Incomplete

#### Feedback

Your DOK2 section shows structure but lacks the synthesis summaries that would connect your facts about AWS preference, acquisition targets, and reliability philosophy into coherent operational frameworks.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Develop operational frameworks: Create summaries that show how AWS-first strategy connects to acquisition criteria, how reliability assumptions affect architecture decisions, and how turnaround processes leverage these principles.

## DOK3 Insight

### Insights Section Empty

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks DOK3 insights, missing the strategic analysis that would reveal patterns from multiple acquisition operations and provide guidance for future decisions.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 200: Deriving DOK3 Insights from Patterns](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Develop operational insights: Analyze patterns across acquisitions to identify what operational approaches work best, where standard practices fail, and what early indicators predict turnaround success.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### AWS Vendor Lock-in Philosophy

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about AWS vendor lock-in being "a big advantage" challenges conventional multi-cloud strategies but needs more development to explain why this approach serves Trilogy's specific needs better.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Expand strategic rationale: Explain how AWS lock-in specifically enables lean operations, reduces complexity, and supports your acquisition integration model. Make the controversial choice actionable for operational decisions.
