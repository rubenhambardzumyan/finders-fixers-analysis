## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Ownership Unclear

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks a clear owner, making accountability and expertise source unclear. Who is responsible for maintaining and evolving this import/integration knowledge?

#### Coaching

Assign clear ownership: Specify the TPM, VP of Engineering, or integration team lead who owns this expertise. This ensures accountability and provides a point of contact for teams implementing these practices.

### Issue 2: Success Metrics Well-Defined

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement provides excellent success criteria: "one quarter without breaking it (defined as generating customer churn)" and "minimal capacity" operations. These specific, measurable targets enable teams to validate success.

## Experts

### Executive Expert Selection

#### Coaching

Add specific relevance: "Nadella's GitHub integration maintained developer autonomy while adding AI capabilities - we adopt this hands-off approach for R&D but disagree for operational systems." Make expert connections actionable.

### Brutal Knowledge Extraction

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about "brutal fast" knowledge extraction in one quarter, accepting some loss because "code, deployments, and customer data tell the real story" is appropriately aggressive and pragmatic.

#### Coaching
