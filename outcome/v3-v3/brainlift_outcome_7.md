## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Product Context vs Educational Theory

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement mentions this "will drive the product development of the AI-First game dev project" but then explicitly states it's "NOT execution oriented." This creates confusion about whether this BrainLift serves product decisions or educational research.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 110: Pick the BrainLift You Need to Create](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Clarify the relationship: "This BrainLift provides educational science foundation for product decisions, not implementation details." Explain how educational theory translates into specific product requirements and constraints.

### Issue 2: Success Metrics Missing

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement describes capturing educational science knowledge but doesn't specify how to measure whether that knowledge effectively drives product outcomes. What educational metrics should the product optimize for?

#### Coaching

Add measurable outcomes: "Enable product decisions that achieve 95% mastery rates, 40 CQPM fluency targets, and 80% student retention across 10-week programs." Connect theory to measurable product success.

## Experts

### Expert Network Absent

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks an experts section, missing opportunities to reference leading educational researchers, cognitive scientists, or game-based learning practitioners whose work could validate and extend your insights.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 121: Building Your Expert Network](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Add key experts: Include cognitive load researchers (Sweller), spaced repetition scientists (Piotr Wozniak), math education specialists (Jo Boaler), and game-based learning experts. This grounds your SPOVs in established research.

## DOK1 Facts

### Specific Thresholds Provided

#### Feedback

Your facts provide concrete, actionable thresholds: 95% accuracy, 40 CQPM, 250ms rapid guess detection, 20% error rate overload triggers. These specific numbers enable immediate product implementation.

#### Coaching

No issues found! Your quantitative thresholds provide clear implementation guidance that product teams can directly translate into game mechanics and algorithms.

## DOK2 Facts

### Three-Stage Learning Arc

#### Feedback

Your DOK2 summary of the mastery → fluency → reinforcement arc effectively synthesizes educational research into a practical framework. The progression from untimed accuracy to timed speed to spaced retention is well-structured.

#### Coaching

No issues found! Your three-stage framework provides clear product architecture guidance while being grounded in educational science principles.

## DOK3 Insight

### Auto-Sizing Algorithm

#### Feedback

Your insight about real-time difficulty adjustment based on error rate (>20%) and latency (>3s) provides a sophisticated alternative to traditional placement tests. The 25% reduction rule with recovery mechanisms is practically implementable.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 200: Deriving DOK3 Insights from Patterns](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

No issues found! This insight bridges educational theory with practical algorithm design, showing how cognitive load management can be automated in real-time.

### Weak Fact Targeting

#### Feedback

Your insight that targeting individual weaknesses cuts mastery time by 40% vs blanket coverage is compelling and directly actionable. This challenges conventional uniform curriculum approaches with personalization.

#### Coaching

Add supporting research: Reference specific studies showing the 40% improvement or similar personalization benefits. This strengthens the evidence base for your recommendation.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### Hard Gates Philosophy

#### Feedback

Your SPOV that "Gates are hard: 95% accuracy + 40 CQPM" with "No soft gates" challenges conventional educational thinking about partial credit and accommodations. This is appropriately controversial.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

No issues found! This SPOV takes a clear stance against grade inflation and ensures genuine mastery, providing specific thresholds that product teams can implement consistently.

### Session Length Optimization

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about 10-15 minute sessions with 60-80 minute weekly targets is specific and actionable. This challenges both traditional longer study sessions and superficial micro-learning approaches.

#### Coaching

Add rationale: Explain why this specific time allocation optimizes retention vs motivation vs practical scheduling constraints. What educational research supports these exact durations?
