## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Stakeholder Focus Clarity

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement mentions being "not technically focused" but "more focused on customers and users," yet several SPOVs are highly technical (forced upgrades, technical debt resolution). This creates confusion about whether this BrainLift serves customer-facing teams or technical decision-makers.

#### Coaching

Clarify the audience: "This BrainLift enables TPMs and product managers to make customer-impact decisions about technical initiatives." Specify how customer insights drive technical prioritization rather than treating these as separate concerns.

### Issue 2: Success Metrics Missing

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement describes Jive's problems and solutions but doesn't specify measurable outcomes. How will you know this BrainLift successfully guides product decisions? What customer or business metrics should improve?

#### Coaching

Add measurable targets: "Enable product decisions that achieve 90% customer retention during upgrades, 50% reduction in security incident escalations, 30% improvement in feature adoption rates." Connect understanding to actionable outcomes.

## Experts

### Expert Network Absent

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks external experts, missing opportunities to reference enterprise software specialists, customer success experts, or product management authorities who could provide broader industry perspective on your insights.

#### Coaching

Add relevant experts: Enterprise software analysts, customer upgrade specialists, security compliance experts, and product lifecycle management authorities. This grounds your SPOVs in broader industry experience.

## DOK1 Facts

### Evidence Foundation Missing

#### Feedback

Your insights reference customer resistance patterns and upgrade challenges but lack supporting data or case studies. Claims about customer behavior need factual foundation for credibility.

#### Coaching

Document specific evidence: Customer survey data, upgrade success rates, security incident frequency, competitive analysis data. This transforms observations into actionable intelligence.

## DOK2 Facts

### Unity Benefits Summary

#### Feedback

Your Jive Unity insight effectively synthesizes multiple technical and business benefits into a coherent strategic rationale. The progression from reduced maintenance to feature superset to operational efficiency is well-structured.

#### Coaching

No issues found! Your Unity analysis clearly connects technical consolidation decisions to business outcomes, enabling stakeholders to understand the strategic value.

## DOK3 Insight

### Customer Resistance Paradox

#### Feedback

Your insight about the disconnect between security importance and upgrade reluctance captures a genuine strategic challenge. This paradox drives both customer churn risk and operational liability, requiring careful navigation.

#### Coaching

No issues found! This insight identifies the core tension that drives many product decisions and provides context for understanding why forced upgrades become necessary despite customer preferences.

### AI Perception Evolution

#### Feedback

Your insight that "time has passed" and AI perceptions may have changed shows awareness that customer attitudes evolve. The shift from OpenAI concerns to Bedrock acceptance demonstrates sophisticated market analysis.

#### Coaching

Add validation plan: "This needs verification with customers" is good, but specify how you'll measure perception changes. Customer surveys, pilot program acceptance rates, or feature request analysis would strengthen this insight.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### Forced Upgrades as Security Imperative

#### Feedback

Your SPOV that "forced customer upgrades are essential" directly challenges customer preferences but is grounded in security reality. This bold stance provides clear decision guidance while acknowledging customer resistance.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

No issues found! This SPOV takes a necessary but unpopular stance supported by security evidence, providing teams with clear justification for difficult customer conversations.

### AI FUD Resolution

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about resolving "FUD around generative AI" with practical solutions (customer keys, local LLMs) demonstrates sophisticated technical understanding while addressing real customer concerns.

#### Coaching

Add implementation specifics: Define what "working with customers to clarify" means in practice. What specific conversations, pilots, or proof-of-concepts will overcome AI resistance?
