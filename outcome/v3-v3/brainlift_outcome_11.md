## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Complex Context Well-Articulated

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement excellently articulates the unique monitoring challenges of acquiring "distressed, rapidly shrinking software companies" with legacy architecture. The specific context (B2B enterprise customers, zero tolerance for outages) justifies the monitoring approach.

#### Coaching

No issues found! Your problem context is comprehensive and clearly explains why conventional monitoring approaches won't work for your specific acquisition scenario.

### Issue 2: Success Metrics Need Quantification

#### Feedback

Your "embarrassing outages" definition provides qualitative guidance but lacks quantitative targets. How much uptime is required? What response time constitutes success? What's the acceptable false positive rate for monitoring alerts?

#### Coaching

Add specific SLOs: "Achieve 99.9% uptime for core features, <5 minute MTTD for business value features, <15% false positive alert rate." Give teams concrete targets to architect monitoring systems toward.

## Experts

### Expert Network Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks external experts despite covering a specialized domain. Monitoring and observability experts, SRE practitioners, and legacy system specialists could provide valuable perspectives.

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 121: Building Your Expert Network](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Add domain experts: Include SRE specialists (Google SRE book authors), monitoring tool creators, legacy modernization experts, and enterprise reliability practitioners. This grounds your approach in broader industry experience.

## DOK1 Facts

### Domain Knowledge Foundation Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift shows comprehensive scope definition but lacks the underlying facts that would support specific monitoring decisions. What are the failure patterns in legacy systems? What monitoring approaches work for heterogeneous stacks?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Document specific evidence: Legacy system failure statistics, monitoring tool effectiveness data, enterprise customer SLO requirements, cost-benefit analysis of different monitoring strategies. Build the factual foundation.

## DOK2 Facts

### Monitoring Strategy Framework Needed

#### Feedback

Your scope definition suggests sophisticated understanding of monitoring challenges, but the DOK2 summaries that would synthesize monitoring patterns and strategies are missing. How do you synthesize learnings across different acquisition monitoring implementations?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 123: Extracting DOK1 Facts and DOK2 Summaries](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Develop synthesis patterns: Create summaries showing how monitoring strategies vary by system age, customer type, architecture pattern. Show the logic chains that lead to specific monitoring decisions.

## DOK3 Insight

### Strategic Monitoring Insights Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks the cross-cutting insights that would emerge from implementing monitoring across multiple legacy acquisitions. What patterns emerge? What counterintuitive findings have you discovered?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 200: Deriving DOK3 Insights from Patterns](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Develop acquisition-specific insights: What monitoring approaches work better than expected for legacy systems? Where do conventional SRE practices fail in your context? What surprising sources provide the best early warning signals?

## DOK4 SPOVs

### Monitoring Philosophy Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift structure suggests sophisticated monitoring thinking but lacks the controversial stances that would guide difficult monitoring decisions. What monitoring principles do you believe in that others might disagree with?

#### Coaching

[BrainLift 201: Building DOK4 SPOVs That Stand Out](https://coach.crossover.com/curriculum)

Develop monitoring SPOVs: Take stances like "Customer-facing monitoring trumps infrastructure monitoring" or "Synthetic monitoring beats APM for legacy systems." Give teams decision-making principles for monitoring investments.
