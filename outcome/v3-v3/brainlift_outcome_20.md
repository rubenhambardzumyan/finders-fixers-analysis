## Purpose Statement

### Issue 1: Aggressive Target Needs Validation

#### Feedback

Your Purpose Statement sets an ambitious goal of "500 active users in 30 days" but doesn't provide evidence that this target is achievable or explain how it was determined. Such aggressive adoption targets need supporting analysis.

#### Coaching

Justify target metrics: Explain how you calculated 500 users as achievable (Trilogy population size, typical adoption rates, engagement patterns). Show the analysis behind your aggressive timeline.

### Issue 2: Success Definition Clear

#### Feedback

Your definition of "active users" as "those who make at least one change in their BrainLift every day" provides specific, measurable criteria that teams can track and optimize against.

#### Coaching

## DOK1 Facts

### Evidence Foundation Needed

#### Feedback

Your insights about user journey design and feedback mechanisms need supporting data. What evidence shows that objective metrics work better than feature usage metrics? Where do users typically get stuck?

#### Coaching

Document adoption research: Add specific data about software adoption patterns, onboarding success rates, user journey optimization, and feedback mechanism effectiveness. Ground strategy in measurable evidence.

## DOK2 Facts

### DOK2 Framework Missing

#### Feedback

Your BrainLift lacks DOK2 summaries that would synthesize adoption research into coherent implementation frameworks. Teams need synthesis of how individual insights connect to create adoption strategies.

#### Coaching

Create adoption frameworks: Develop summaries that connect user psychology, onboarding design, feedback mechanisms, and champion cultivation into comprehensive adoption strategies.

## DOK3 Insight

### Power User Strategy

#### Feedback

Your insight about limiting initial users until demonstrating success with a small cohort prevents "burning users like a meat grinder" and creates a foundation for sustainable growth. This challenges typical broad rollout approaches.

#### Coaching

No issues found! This insight provides strategic guidance that prioritizes long-term adoption success over short-term user acquisition metrics.

### User Journey Focus

#### Feedback

Your insight about focusing on customer value rather than feature usage provides important strategic guidance for measuring adoption success. This prevents teams from optimizing for vanity metrics.

#### Coaching

Add implementation specifics: Define what constitutes "customer value" metrics versus "feature usage" metrics. Provide examples of good vs bad adoption measurement approaches.

## DOK4 SPOVs

### Knowledge Management Evolution

#### Feedback

Your SPOV that companies not embracing BrainLifting are "doomed to extinction" is bold and creates urgency around adoption. This challenges traditional knowledge management approaches while providing clear strategic direction.

#### Coaching

No issues found! This SPOV creates appropriate urgency while positioning BrainLifts as essential rather than optional for competitive survival.

### Emotional Onboarding Focus

#### Feedback

Your SPOV about making users feel they can "win" rather than just demonstrating features addresses the emotional barriers that cause adoption failure. This challenges feature-focused onboarding approaches.

#### Coaching

Add implementation guidance: Define what "making users feel they can win" looks like in practice. What specific onboarding experiences create this emotional state versus overwhelming users?
