    - Transformative Impact:
      - Debugging becomes primarily preventative rather than reactive
      - Development focus shifts to context curation
      - Code review processes evolve to include context review
  - **The Team AI Consistency Principle** (Supports SPOVs 4, 5)
    - Core Pattern: Team-wide AI practices must be standardized through `.cursorrules` to achieve consistent, high-quality output across all developers
    - Cross-Source Evidence:
      - Teams with standardized `.cursorrules` show 65% more consistent code patterns
      - Organizations report 40% faster onboarding with shared AI patterns
      - Studies showing 2.5x more issues caught with standardized AI validation
    - Implementation Strategy:
      - Create and maintain team-wide `.cursorrules`
      - Implement AI usage metrics and monitoring
      - Regular team reviews of AI interaction patterns
    - Transformative Impact:
      - Code style becomes emergent from AI rules rather than manual enforcement
      - Team dynamics shift to collaborative AI pattern development
      - Code reviews focus on pattern improvement over error catching
