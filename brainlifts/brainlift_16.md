Crossover Hire BrainLift v2

- Owner(s)
  - Andrew Allen, Dragos Nuta, Heather Lother, Kevin Norchi, Tamas Szabo
- Purpose
  - To distill expertise in global remote recruiting into actionable rules for identifying, assessing, and hiring the top 1% of global talent through scalable, objective, and AI-enhanced processes.
  - Expertise in specific domains is not necessarily in scope as Crossover works with SMEs to build accurate, objective hiring mechanisms
  - Out of scope:
    - Compensation policy/levels - these are inputs for customers, but we may advise customers in some cases
- _----------- Depth of Knowledge / DOK starts here ----------_
- DOK4/SPOV
  - Traditional geographic hiring constraints artificially limit companies to mediocre talent; only borderless recruiting accesses the true top 1%.
  - Objective skills assessment through real work tests is the only reliable predictor of job performance, not resumes or credentials.
  - Cognitive ability (measured by CCAT) is a non-negotiable filter for all knowledge work positions.
  - Companies that make AI adoption optional are actively sabotaging their workforce's competitiveness. Furthermore, we are past the point where want to coach for AI; new hires must be already all in on AI
  - Hiring managers should be calibrated against objective assessment data, not allowed to rely on subjective interview impressions.
  - The future of recruiting belongs to Organization Builders who can reverse-engineer roles into objective skill requirements, not traditional recruiters.
  - Community building KPIs should prioritize engagement over follower count to reflect genuine audience connection.
  - Hiring top 1% global talent requires sourcing at scale backed up by algorithms and analytics rather than traditional recruiter-driven approaches.
  - Generic job posts are terrible. Persona-targeted content strategies that demonstrate thought leadership, as these generate 3X better qualified candidate rates
  - Programmatic job advertising must prioritize end-of-funnel conversion quality. Optimizing for early stage metrics (like apply or basic-fit metrics) leads to waste of money and time.
- DOK3 - Insights
  - Global remote recruiting creates a 1000x larger candidate pool, requiring fundamentally different filtering mechanisms than traditional recruiting.
  - When candidates can come from anywhere, application volumes of 1,000-2,000 per hire become normal, making automated screening essential.
  - Drop out rates are huge without a high touch process (which is anyway not feasible to us) - 50% of the candidates don't put in the time in taking all tests.
  - Real-work assessments that mirror actual job tasks provide stronger hiring signals than traditional interviews or credentials.
  - Calibrating assessments against existing team performance creates an objective quality bar that continuously improves team capability.
  - The combination of cognitive testing, skills assessment, and real-work performance creates a more reliable prediction of success than traditional hiring methods.
  - Remote work introduces unique challenges in candidate evaluation, requiring specialized tools and processes to prevent fraud and ensure quality.
  - AI is transforming both the recruiting process itself and the skills candidates need to demonstrate for success.
  - Featuring real employees as the face of company content dramatically increases audience trust and engagement.
  - Platforms with lower in-market buyer ratios require significantly more sophisticated marketing strategies.
  - Consistent publishing cadence builds compounding audience growth that outperforms sporadic viral hits.
  - Traditional programmatic job advertising platforms optimize for local hiring patterns, creating structural disadvantages for global remote hiring models.
  - The effectiveness of sourcing channels varies dramatically by role seniority, with leadership positions showing the greatest platform sensitivity.
  - Candidate conversion quality from LinkedIn consistently outperforms all alternative channels by a range of 2-5x.
  - Global remote roles demand fundamentally different advertising strategies than location-specific roles, requiring separate algorithmic approaches.
  - Platforms with fixed-cost models (LinkedIn) require fundamentally different optimization strategies than CPC models (Indeed).
  - Strong and long-standing body of research demonstrates that cognitive aptitude is one of the most accurate predictors of job success.
  - AI functions as a powerful skill leveler, disproportionately boosting lower-performing workers and compressing performance distributions.
  - AI outputs tend toward homogeneity, creating both quality floors and creativity ceilings. This means that human expertise is what will make the difference between a good work unit and a great work unit.
  - Unstructured interviews (not focused on Job-Relevant Skills and Competencies, with a clear rubric) should be banned entirely from hiring processes - they're no better than random selection and perpetuate unconscious bias regardless of interviewer training
  - Thought leadership metrics must measure audience impact, not just reach, to drive true business value.
  - Non-job platforms require specialized marketing expertise to become viable sourcing channels.
  - Gauntlet program is proof of successful influencer-led recruiting. Austen managed to build a class of 300 hundreds of talented students of which 100 turned into great hires in a short amount of time, without a huge ad budget, leveraging his captive personal audience of 400K followers on X

- ==Badges==
  - DOK1 Fact: cognitive aptitude is one of the most accurate predictors of job success: 1.6x as predictive as unstructured interviews, 4x as predictive as experience.
    > [https://www.criteriacorp.com/files/Criteria-InfoBrief-CCAT.pdf](https://www.criteriacorp.com/files/Criteria-InfoBrief-CCAT.pdf)
  - DOK1 Fact: Cognitive aptitude is a critical underlying factor for almost every job, since all jobs require people to process information, solve problems and learn new information
  - DOK1 Fact: adding even a small amount of structure to the interview process can enhance its predictive validity from 0.20 to 0.35, with fully structured interviews achieving a validity of 0.57
  - DOK1 Fact: structured interviews have the highest variability in validity (i.e., .42 +/− .24) among top predictors (Sackett et al., Reference Sackett, Zhang, Berry and Lievens2023; Table 1). Such a level of inconsistency is concerning and warrants closer examination
  - DOK1 Fact: 78 percent of HR professionals say the quality of their organization’s hires has improved due to their use of assessments
