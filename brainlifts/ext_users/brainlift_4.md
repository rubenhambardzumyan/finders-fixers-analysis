BrainLift: AI-Powered Codebase Onboarding for Maximum Productivity

- Owner(s): ﻿Bach Ly
- Purpose: To evaluate AI-driven developer tools that streamline the code-base onboarding phase at Trilogy, with the aim of cutting at least 50 % of the toil involved in parsing legacy documentation, grasping project architecture, and mapping business domains to source modules—so new engineers can progress from clone to first productive commit dramatically faster.

  - Most of grunt tasks can be reduce upto 50% completion time due to the help of LLM

    - DOK2: Summary
      - AI helps reduce a lot of time in simple task
    - DOK1: Facts
      - Documenting code functionality for maintainability (which considers how easily code can be improved) can be completed in half the time
      - Writing new code in nearly half the time
      - Optimizing existing code (called code refactoring) in nearly two-thirds the time
  - LLM-Powered Codebase Exploration: Master the use of AI tools (like GitHub Copilot, Cody, Cursor, etc.) to semantically search, summarize, and navigate large unfamiliar codebases. This knowledge area includes techniques for prompt engineering, embedding-based search, and code-aware querying. It directly reduces onboarding time and makes architecture/domain mapping much faster.
