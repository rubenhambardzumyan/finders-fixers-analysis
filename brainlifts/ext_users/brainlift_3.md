    - Purpose
      - The purpose of this BrainLift is to build deep expertise in designing and implementing AWS cost optimization automation that (1) comprehensively detects and addresses all possible cost-saving opportunities across our cloud environment, and (2) provides accurate, defensible measurement and attribution of realized savings - enabling the Cost Optimization Team to maximize financial impact, demonstrate value to stakeholders, and drive continuous improvement.
      - In scope: Automation design/implementation, opportunity detection, savings measurement/attribution in AWS environments.
      - Out of scope: Tool/vendor selection, influencing other teams’ adoption, non-AWS platforms.
    - DOK4 - SPOV / New Knowledge
      - No metric, no optimization: evidence-based savings are non-negotiable.
        - If AWS cost optimization is not grounded in transparent, defensible savings metrics, it does not just risk wasted effort, it systematically entrenches technical and organizational debt, eroding trust and stifling future innovation. True optimization demands evidence-based accountability, not assumptions, to ensure financial integrity and strategic progress.
        - Application Triggers:
          - Implement mandatory measurement when: Any cost optimization initiative exceeds $10K in potential savings or requires more than 40 hours of engineering effort.
          - Escalate to evidence-based framework when: Teams report "savings" without baseline CUR data or cannot attribute improvements to specific actions within 30 days.
          - Reject optimization proposals when: They lack pre/post measurement methodology or cannot demonstrate savings attribution to individual resources/actions.
          - Require enhanced measurement rigor when: Optimization affects production systems, involves automated remediation, or impacts multiple teams/business units.
      - Optimize for adaptability, not just savings: dynamic automation beats static efficiency.
        - The true value of AWS cost optimization automation lies not in rigid cost minimization but in maximizing adaptive capacity; even if that means tolerating calculated spend volatility. Static efficiency stifles innovation and agility; dynamic optimization, intelligently guided by business context and automation, is the essential driver of competitive advantage.
        - Application Triggers:
          - Choose dynamic over static optimization when: Development teams deploy more than 3x per week or business requirements change monthly, requiring rapid resource scaling.
          - Implement flexibility buffer strategy when: Innovation velocity and time-to-market matter more than maximum discount capture (e.g., startup phases, competitive product launches).
          - Avoid rigid Reserved Instance commitments when: Workload patterns are unpredictable, expected to change >30% quarter-over-quarter, or supporting experimental/R&D initiatives.
          - Prioritize adaptive automation when: Manual intervention for scaling takes >2 hours or costs exceed $500/incident in engineering time.
          - Accept calculated spend volatility when: Business agility gains (faster feature delivery, reduced downtime) demonstrably outweigh 10-20% cost optimization potential.
      - Visibility alone is useless, expensive reporting - showback must drive real-time, AI-powered action.
        - Showback, when implemented in isolation, risks devolving into mere cost visibility without action; it only transforms into actionable financial discipline when embedded within an AI-driven, metric-rich, and real-time optimization framework.
        - Application triggers:
          - Upgrade from basic showback to AI-powered action when: Monthly cost reports exist but optimization actions decrease by >50% after initial 90-day period, indicating visibility fatigue.
          - Implement real-time alerting when: Cost anomalies exceed $1K/day or represent >15% deviation from baseline, requiring immediate intervention rather than monthly reporting.
          - Deploy automated remediation when: Teams repeatedly ignore the same cost optimization recommendations for 3+ consecutive months in showback reports.
          - Transition to AI-driven optimization when: Manual analysis of cost data consumes >8 hours/week of engineering time or delays optimization decisions by >48 hours.
          - Abandon showback-only approach when: Visibility exists but measurable cost reduction actions drop below 1 optimization per team per month.
          - Require action-linked showback when: AWS spend exceeds $100K/month or involves >5 development teams, making manual cost correlation ineffective.
          - Escalate to automated, metric-rich showback when: Business units continue to exceed budget targets for two consecutive cycles, despite regular reporting visibility.
      - Showback without real authority breeds waste, sometimes, central AI-driven control is essential for real optimization.
        - Showback's potential for cloud waste stems from fostering a false sense of cost ownership in teams lacking the authority, expertise, or incentive alignment to act on the data. While decentralized FinOps models are ideal, when they fail to deliver, strategic centralization, augmented by AI-driven governance and enforcement, can become the necessary lever for reclaiming control and achieving sustainable optimization.
        - Application Triggers:
          - Implement centralized AI-driven control when: Decentralized FinOps fails to deliver measurable cost reductions within 90 days despite clear showback data and recommendations.
          - Escalate to central enforcement when: Teams consistently acknowledge cost optimization opportunities but take no action for 2+ consecutive reporting cycles.
          - Apply centralized governance when: Cloud spend increases >20% month-over-month across multiple teams without corresponding business value justification.
          - Require central AI-driven intervention when: Manual team-level optimization efforts consistently miss obvious savings opportunities (>$1K/month per team) identified by automated analysis.
          - Centralize control when: Teams lack budget authority to act on optimization recommendations or require approval cycles >5 business days for basic resource changes.
          - Revert to decentralized model when: Central AI-driven controls achieve sustained 15%+ cost reduction and teams demonstrate consistent optimization behavior for 6+ months.
      - Flexibility buffers outperform static commitments; rigidity costs more than invoices reveal.
        - Prioritizing a dynamically-managed On-Demand “flexibility buffer” over maximum Reserved Instance or Savings Plan coverage unlocks long-term savings and innovation velocity that static commitment strategies can never match. The true cost of rigidity is not visible on the invoice, it is measured in missed opportunities, stranded capital, and stifled innovation.
        - Application Triggers
          - Implement flexibility buffer strategy when: Development velocity exceeds 10 deployments per week or business requirements change more than 30% quarter-over-quarter.
          - Choose buffers over maximum RI coverage when: Innovation initiatives or product experiments represent >25% of compute workload and require rapid scaling.
          - Maintain 15-30% On-Demand buffer when: Time-to-market pressure exists and delayed scaling would cost >$10K per day in opportunity cost or revenue impact.
          - Avoid rigid commitment strategies when: Historical workload variance exceeds 40% month-over-month or when supporting R&D/proof-of-concept environments.
          - Prioritize flexibility over discount maximization when: Engineering teams report resource constraints delaying feature delivery by >2 weeks due to capacity planning limitations.
          - Quantify rigidity costs when: Stranded Reserved Instance capacity exceeds 20% utilization for 3+ consecutive months or when commitment modifications occur more than twice per year.
      - Measure automation's true cost, the overhead can outweigh the savings.
        - Every layer of AWS cost optimization automation that is not explicitly measured for its operational overhead and justified by its net impact risks becoming a net liability rather than an asset. Excellence in automation means continuously quantifying not just the direct cost savings, but also the operational complexity, reliability risk, and engineering drag introduced. Otherwise, your optimization engine may inadvertently drive you backwards.
        - Application Triggers
          - Audit automation ROI when: Total operational overhead (maintenance, monitoring, incident response) exceeds 25% of gross savings generated by the automation.
          - Discontinue automation when: Engineering time spent on automation maintenance exceeds 40 hours per quarter without delivering net savings >$5K/month.
          - Require overhead measurement when: Automation complexity introduces >2 additional failure modes or requires specialized team knowledge to maintain.
          - Simplify automation when: Incident response time for automation failures exceeds 4 hours or requires escalation to senior engineers >3 times per quarter.
          - Justify automation layers when: Each layer cannot demonstrate independent net savings >$1K/month after accounting for operational costs and engineering drag.
          - Implement automation sunset reviews when: System reliability decreases or mean-time-to-recovery increases by >15% after automation deployment.
          - Revert to manual processes when: Automation operational costs plus engineering overhead exceed 80% of gross savings for 2+ consecutive quarters.

    - DOK3 - Insights
      - Premature cost visibility destroys long-term optimization outcomes, despite initial savings that make showback systems appear successful. When engineering teams receive granular cost attribution before their architectures mature, they optimize for immediate expense reduction rather than sustainable design—creating technical debt through over-committed Reserved Instances, rigid scaling patterns, and brittle automation that breaks during growth phases. The most cost-effective organizations deliberately withhold showback data for new services until architectural patterns stabilize (typically 6-12 months), recognizing that early cost pressure drives engineers toward solutions that appear cheaper initially but cost 2-3x more to evolve or replace. Teams with delayed cost visibility but strong architectural guardrails consistently achieve 20-30% lower total cost of ownership over 24 months compared to early-showback teams, because they remain free to adopt fundamentally different approaches rather than optimizing within constrained, legacy patterns.
      - Organizations that achieve the highest AWS cost efficiency deliberately reject dynamic scaling for 60-70% of their workloads, despite having the technical capability to implement it. While FinOps orthodoxy promotes elasticity as universally beneficial, the most cost-effective teams recognize that the cognitive overhead of maintaining elastic systems creates invisible organizational debt that compounds over time. Engineers working on dynamically scaling systems spend 40-60% more time on operational tasks, debugging race conditions, and managing state complexity—time that could generate more business value than the compute savings achieved. Counter-intuitively, teams that strategically choose "expensive" static provisioning for non-critical workloads free up engineering capacity to optimize the 20-30% of systems where elasticity delivers 10x returns, achieving better overall financial outcomes than organizations that chase elasticity everywhere. The highest-performing cost optimization teams maintain deliberate "scaling debt" in predictable workloads to preserve innovation velocity on systems where dynamic behavior actually matters.
      - The most cost-effective AWS organizations deliberately under-commit to Reserved Instances and Savings Plans, even when they have clear, predictable workloads that would mathematically justify full commitment coverage. This counterintuitive approach stems from recognizing that commitment optimization creates a hidden organizational anti-pattern: teams begin architecting around their financial commitments rather than business requirements. When organizations lock in 80%+ commitment coverage, engineering teams unconsciously start designing systems to "feed" existing commitments, leading to architectural debt that compounds over years. The most sophisticated cost optimization teams maintain 40-60% commitment coverage specifically to preserve "architectural optionality" - the ability to migrate to fundamentally different services (containers to serverless, EC2 to managed services) without being anchored by sunk cost bias. Counter-intuitively, organizations that accept higher per-hour compute costs through strategic under-commitment often achieve 20-30% better total cost of ownership over 24-36 months because they remain free to adopt cost-disruptive technologies like Fargate, Lambda, or next-generation instance families. The commitment paradox reveals that optimizing for today's discount rates can trap organizations in yesterday's architecture, while strategic "financial slack" enables teams to continuously chase the steepest cost reduction curves through architectural evolution rather than incremental efficiency gains.
      - Organizations that achieve the lowest AWS total cost of ownership deliberately consolidate into fewer regions, even when distributed architectures would reduce latency and theoretically lower data transfer costs. This counterintuitive pattern emerges because the hidden operational complexity of multi-region management creates exponential cost growth that dwarfs the savings from regional price arbitrage. Teams managing truly distributed workloads spend 3-4x more engineering time on deployment orchestration, monitoring correlation, incident response, and compliance validation across regulatory boundaries - time that could deliver more business value than the 10-20% infrastructure savings achieved through regional optimization. The most cost-effective organizations recognize that "regional efficiency" creates a cognitive load trap: engineers become regional firefighters rather than feature builders. Counter-intuitively, teams that deliberately choose "expensive" single-region architectures (accepting higher compute costs and latency penalties) often achieve 25-40% better total cost of ownership because they can deploy automation, monitoring, and optimization systems with dramatically lower complexity. The geographic anchor effect reveals that the pursuit of perfect regional distribution fragments engineering focus across time zones, regulatory regimes, and operational contexts, creating coordination overhead that compounds exponentially with each additional region. Strategic geographic consolidation enables teams to build deeper, more sophisticated automation within constrained boundaries rather than shallow optimization across distributed complexity.

            - This area encompasses strategies, frameworks, and technical approaches for quantifying actual savings generated by automation, attributing them to specific actions, and ensuring defensible reporting.
    - DOK2 - Summary
      - AWS Resource Utilization Analysis and Opportunity Detection
        - Effective AWS resource utilization analysis integrates a foundational understanding of key AWS services. A thorough analysis requires regular reviews of resource inventories, leveraging tagging strategies and Cost Explorer’s visualizations to identify idle or underutilized assets, detect spending anomalies, and correlate costs with resource location—recognizing that AWS Regions are geographically distinct, with potentially significant pricing differences. Strategic region selection and careful placement of resources can reduce costs and avoid unnecessary inter-region data transfer fees. Beyond these basics, proactive cost optimization involves several targeted practices which include but not limited to: avoiding End-of-Life (EOL) service versions to eliminate extended support fees, implementing a purchasing strategy that balances On-Demand and Reserved Instances for optimal flexibility and savings, preventing EC2 over-provisioning, enabling enhanced health reporting in Elastic Beanstalk only where necessary to avoid extra monitoring costs, optimizing load balancer usage by selecting the appropriate ALB, NLB, or CLB type and decommissioning unused resources, matching database engine types to workload patterns, ensuring related resources (such as EC2 and RDS) are co-located within the same region to minimize latency and transfer fees, preferring private, intra-region connectivity for RDS access rather than public endpoints for both security and cost efficiency. Together, these practices form an integrated, repeatable framework for systematically uncovering and addressing inefficiencies, enabling comprehensive opportunity detection and sustainable cost optimization across AWS environments.
      - Automated Remediation Architechture and Implementation
        - Automated remediation in AWS environments is built on orchestrating serverless services like Lambda and Step Functions, combined with robust event-driven triggers from CloudWatch Alarms. By embedding automation with secure IAM permissions and thorough logging, teams can safely and efficiently execute actions such as resizing resources, terminating idle instances, or enforcing tagging policies. Incorporating features like dry-run modes and rollback mechanisms ensures changes are reversible and transparent, while approval workflows and audit trails provide governance and traceability. Together, these practices enable reliable, scalable, and low-risk automation of cost-saving actions across diverse AWS workloads. Moreover, idle resources can be detected using tools and APIs such as Compute Optimizer. The automation strategies can be dry-run before implementation and safe-rollback mechanisms implemented to be used when required.
      - Cost Savings Measurement and Attribution Methodologies
        - To effectively measure and attribute AWS cost savings, organizations need to combine detailed usage data with robust tagging and allocation practices. By leveraging the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR), teams can analyze granular billing information for individual resources. Applying cost allocation tags enables categorization of spend by project or owner, while frameworks like showback and chargeback use these data points to transparently report or bill costs to responsible groups. Together, these practices provide the foundation for accurate, defensible savings measurement and foster financial accountability in cloud environments.

        - Avoiding End-of-Life (EOL) Service Versions to Eliminate Extended Support Fees
          - Relevance: AWS imposes additional charges for using database engine versions (such as RDS) that have reached End-of-Life (EOL) status. Running workloads on EOL versions not only leads to higher operational costs due to premium support or extended maintenance fees, but also increases risk and can limit access to security updates and new features. Proactive monitoring of service version lifecycles, and scheduling timely upgrades to supported versions, ensures you avoid unnecessary EOL fees and maintain a secure, cost-effective environment.

        - Instance Purchasing Strategy: On-Demand vs Reserved
          - Relevance: A major lever for AWS cost optimization is analyzing workload patterns to determine when to use on-demand pricing versus committing to Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans. On-demand instances offer flexibility, but come at a premium. For steady-state or predictable workloads, long-term commitments can deliver substantial discounts, often 30–70% compared to on-demand rates. Cost optimization automation should regularly assess usage patterns, recommend or automate RI/Savings Plan purchases where appropriate, and monitor utilization to avoid over- or under-commitment.

        - Region Selection for Cost Efficiency
          - Relevance: AWS service pricing varies significantly by region, with some regions offering lower rates for compute, storage, and data transfer. By strategically choosing regions that are both geographically close to end users (to minimize latency) and cost-effective, organizations can reduce operational expenses without compromising performance. Regularly reviewing AWS pricing across regions and factoring in business requirements (such as compliance, redundancy, and latency) enables informed decisions that maximize cost savings.

        - EC2 Over-Provisioning for Peak Demand
          - Relevance: In AWS environments, leaving EC2 instances vertically over-provisioned for peak demand is a common source of waste, but the root causes often extend beyond technical oversight—encompassing organizational risk aversion, lack of automation expertise, and misaligned incentives. While dynamic adjustment through autoscaling or scheduled resizing can yield significant savings, the real opportunity lies in systematically identifying which workloads are truly suitable for elasticity and weighing the operational costs and business risks of automation against potential savings. Strategic cost optimization, therefore, requires not just technical solutions, but a cultural and process shift that aligns efficiency with business priorities—ensuring teams are empowered, incentivized, and equipped to continually right-size their cloud resources.

        - Optimal Size EC2 Instances and Autoscaling in Elastic Beanstalk
          - Relevance: Regularly review and adjust the instance types and sizes used by your environments. Leverage Beanstalk’s support for autoscaling groups to dynamically scale in/out based on demand. This prevents overprovisioning and reduces idle capacity costs.

        - Enable Enhanced Health Reporting in Elastic Beanstalk only when needed
          - Relevance: Use enhanced health reporting in production environments, but disable it in dev/test where not needed. This is because enhanced reporting incurrs additional costs.

        - Optimize Load Balancer Usage
          - Relevance: Select the most cost-effective load balancer type (ALB/NLB/CLB) for your workload, and decommission unused load balancers. This is because load balances have an ongoing hourly and data processing fees.
          - Source: [https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/load-balancing/](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/load-balancing/)
        - Database Type-Workload Mismatch
          - Relevance: A frequent cost inefficiency in AWS environments is persisting structured, relational data in NoSQL databases (such as DynamoDB) instead of using managed SQL solutions (like Amazon RDS). This misalignment can drive up costs and reduce efficiency. Regularly reviewing database usage patterns and matching database type to workload characteristics can reveal opportunities for significant cost savings and performance improvements.

        - Inefficient Cross-Region Resource Placement
          - Relevance: Another often-overlooked source of AWS waste is running EC2 instances and RDS databases in different regions when co-location is possible and preferable. This setup incurs unnecessary inter-region data transfer fees and can negatively impact latency. Regular audits to identify and realign related resources within the same region can immediately cut data transfer costs and streamline system design.

        - Public RDS Access vs. Private Intra-Region Access
          - Relevance: Allowing access to an Amazon RDS instance via a public IP, even when secured by whitelisting in security groups, can lead to unnecessary data transfer costs if application servers (EC2s) are in the same region. In many cases, routing traffic privately within the AWS network (using private endpoints or VPC connectivity) is both more secure and more cost-efficient. Regularly reviewing RDS access patterns and eliminating unnecessary public exposure can reduce data transfer fees and improve the overall security posture.

          - Relevance: Alarms are often used to initiate automated remediation workflows.
        - Dry-Run Mode for Automation
          - Relevance: Incorporate a dry-run mode into all remediation workflows to simulate actions without making real changes. In dry-run mode, the automation should log all intended actions and outcomes, allowing teams to review the impact, identify edge cases, and validate logic before executing changes in production. This approach helps catch errors, ensures alignment with business policies, and provides a safe environment for continuous improvement of automation scripts.

        - Safe Rollback Mechanisms
          - Relevance: Design cost optimization automation with built-in rollback mechanisms to quickly and reliably reverse any remediation action if unintended consequences or failures are detected. This involves capturing the “before” state (such as instance size/configuration, tags, or schedule) before making changes, and providing automated tools to restore resources to their original state. Implementing robust rollback procedures minimizes business risk and increases stakeholder trust in automation.

        - Idle Resource Detection
          - Relevance: Idle EC2 instances, EC2 Auto Scaling groups, EBS volumes, ECS services on Fargate and RDS databases, those running without meaningful workload or utilization for extended periods, represent a direct and often substantial source of unnecessary AWS spend. Detecting such resources can involve using Compute Optimizer, analyzing CPU, network, and disk activity over time, cross-referencing with usage patterns, and confirming with resource owners. Proactively monitoring for and automatically flagging or stopping idle EC2s can drive significant, recurring savings and is a foundational practice in any robust cost optimization automation.

          - Relevance: Tagging is necessary for precise savings measurement and reporting.
        - Showback is the process of sharing cloud usage and cost data with business units or teams for visibility and accountability, without billing them, while chargeback involves allocating and billing actual cloud costs to those groups based on their usage.

          - Relevance: These concepts are fundamental to cost allocation and attribution methodologies in AWS environments, enabling organizations to promote responsible cloud usage and financial accountability.
    - Items in the BrainLift are based on DOK constructs
      - DOK = Depth of Knowledge
        - DOK1 - **facts**
          - recall and reproduction: learners must have command of the facts
          - facts come from sources (each article, blog, post, etc. is a source)
          - facts are objective - same for anybody that reads the source
        - DOK2 - **summary**
          - basic application of ~~skills~~ and concepts - logically tying the facts together to understand how or why something occurs, direct causality and chaining
          - summaries are of an individual source
          - summaries are objective - directly supported by the facts in the source
          - early learning (before SPOVs) - summaries are the same or similar for anybody that reads the source and what an LLM would summarize
          - once there are SPOVs - reader will summarize in the context of their SPOVs, which may lead to summaries different than others or an LLM
        - DOK3 - **insights**
          - strategic thinking - insights are surprising, contrarian, interesting patterns or logical chains that transcend multiple sources, etc.
          - insights are subjective - an individual creates these based on their analysis of underlying DOK1 and DOK2 information
          - insights must be supported by DOK1 and DOK2 - otherwise, they are baseless claims
        - DOK4 - **spiky points of view / new knowledge**
          - extended thinking - transference of insights from multiple domains to create new knowledge
          - new knowledge is subjective - directly supported by DOK3 from multiple domains
          - new knowledge is expressed as spiky points of view (spov) - short bright line statements that crystalize one's new expertise
            - these are assertions, not explanations
          - spov are the rules that guide our actions and the basis for one's operating decisions
          - spov are the rules that govern how AI should think to be consistent with the one's world view
          - spov are the lens through with the user will read and comment (in public) on sources
    - Key invariants and seams in BrainLift usage of the DOK constructs
      - BrainLift is owned by a person, not a system or AI
      - BRIGHT LINE between DOK1-2 and DOK3-4
        - DOK1-2 are based on the external world
        - DOK3-4 are based on ones own expertise
      - BRIGHT LINE between DOK1 and DOK2
        - no learning occurs pulling DOK1 facts out of a source - AI can do this for you
        - learning occurs when a learner creates their own DOK2-4 - can initially use AI assist to understand the source material
        - user needs to type their own DOK2-4 into the BrainLift, ideally only after directly reading the actual source material
      - BRIGHT LINE between BrainLift and BrainMaxxing
        - Humans curate and edit their own BrainLift. Period. No automation or cut-and-paste.
        - Deciding what to add, edit, remove and how to organize the BrainLift is part of DOK2 learning.
        - BrainMaxxing is focused at exposing the user to the flow of relevant information in the world and does not modify, or even propose updates to, a BrainLift.
      - To learn, an owner must constantly curate and refactor their BrainLift
        - test DOK3-4 against new DOK1-2 data - if new data contradicts, why? do you need to evolve your DOK3-4 world view?
        - replace existing DOK1-2 sources with better/more credible DOK1-2 sources (do not simply append, one learns when they test and decide whether to swap or not to swap)
        - refactor organization of DOK1-2 material as one's DOK3-4 evolve
        - crufty BrainLifts become more and more useless over time
- Using BrainLifts: BrainMaxxing, Ephor, and (AI)PI
  - Ephor Invite Link: [https://ephor.ai/join/d5001aa7](https://ephor.ai/join/d5001aa7)
  - BrainMaxxing relies on key BrainLift seams to reinforce the core knowledge creation process
    - BrainMaxxing is a process, feed, and coaches the user on building great BrainLifts
    - D - domain
      - BrainMaxxing has to be **great** at finding new source material
        - Search from BrainLift experts as well as tangential sources (comments, posts like this one)
        - Scan for content based on DOK3 insights and DOK2 summaries
        - Scan for content based on ephor project activity in projects that have BrainLifts
        - Etc.
        - In general, anything in the BrainLift (or user’s set of BrainLifts) is fair game for BrainMaxxing to use to kick off async deep research, or other thread pulling, to go find more sources
        - Etc.
    - A - actions
      - BrainMaxxing has to be **great** at curating the user's feed, most important posts first
        - Each project will have a single BrainMaxxing feed for the project
        - Each user will have a single personal BrainMaxxing feed
          - User will be able to subscribe to multiple BrainLifts: their personal BrainLifts, project BrainLifts, other public BrainLifts (e.g. our AI multiplexer BrainLift)
            - Will receive BrainMaxxing posts for all the raw sources associated with this feed
            - Will receive BrainMaxxing generated posts each time the BrainLift is modified
            - Won't be too much - ultimately BrainMaxxing algo will filter and useless stuff will never show up.
          - BrainMaxxing combines and interleaves the feeds for each of a user's subscribed BrainLifts for that user
          - BrainMaxxing algorithm determines the order that a user sees content - over time, it needs to be great at filtering and sequencing for highest impact
      - Should extract facts from sources and generate posts for the users's feed containing DOK1 facts, citations, and link to the actual source.
        - BM posts should be and presented to user over time (borrowing from spaced repetition)
        - User should be able to bookmark posts
          - once they have wallowed in the sources and data, will go back to the bookmarked posts to decide whether it should be included in the BrainLift (then include it with DOK1 facts and DOK2 summaries).
          - the act of deciding to include or not, as well as organizing in the KT is DOK2
        - BM posts should be color coded as green (source supports existing DOK3 and DOK4) or red (source existing contradicts DOK3 and DOK4).
          - BrainMaxxing looks at the facts and source author's proposed insights to determine green/red
          - Won't color code if post is not obviously green/red
      - QC reviews and coaches user on BrainLifts
        - Checks that DOK4 is supported by multiple DOK3, and DOK3 is supported by DOK1 and 2
        - It's still a valid BrainLift file without this support, but calls into question the expertise of the author if they are making empty claims

      - Feedback and coaching on quality of BrainLift data structure
    - S - Simple
      - User should get realtime and async coaching on improving the BrainLift
      - User should be able to kick off an async research task directly based on something in the post
        - BrainMaxxing should be aware of this and the results, treating the results as "a new fact source" for the feed
  - (AI)PI = BrainLift should be accessible via (AI)PI
    - Used by Ephor, code-as-caller, LLM-as-caller, and human-as-caller patterns
    - Ephor talks to (AI)PI, not Workflowy directly
    - Workflowy may be a UI on top of a more durable / flexible data structure
    - (AI)PI server can enforce key seams, consistency checking, etc.
      - DOK4 relies on DOK3 that use DOK1/2 - flag if these source authors are not in the Experts list (owner has to affirmatively add the expert)
      - Flag DOK4 without 2 or more DOK3's, DOK3 without at least one supportive Source, etc.
      - Flag if AI believes a Source is in the wrong node of the Knowledge Tree
  - Ephor causes LLMs to enforce SPOVs
    - SPOV must be short and simple and without explanation.
    - SPOV serve as rules to focus SPOV.
    - Remainder of BrainLift is interesting Domain context, but not what is used to focus LLM response
  - **It is up to the user to add / modify the BrainLift** based on key learning processes:
    - Is it worth putting this into the knowledge tree with new DOK1 and DOK2 info?
      - Have I read it in the context of my SPOV?
      - Does something come out of the tree in favor of this more credible information?
      - Is there contradictory information that causes me to rethink my DOK3 and DOK4?
    - Does the inclusion of this source cause me to create/update my DOK3 insights?
      - If yes, I should post in public to see comments/reactions to my insights
    - Do the changes to DOK3 cause me to create new knowledge, and update my DOK4 spov?
      - If yes, I should post public to show off my expertise.
    - Have done all this, do I need to restructure my DOK2 knowledge tree?
    - Should I add the source's author to my BrainLift experts?
  - BrainLifts should be pushed and consumed organization wide to accelerate learning
    - Ephor coach should create experts based on BrainLift (AI)PI
      - BrainLifts as experts are in the Ephor council of kings and expert debates
      - BrainLifts as experts are used by Ephor Coach to give realtime advice and coaching
        - For example, our AI coding and AI cursor BrainLifts are dynamic Ephor experts that the RealTime coach will automatically load when the user has Cursor open
        - Experts give real time feedback to user to do better in cursor: "hey, stop asking Cursor to fix the bug - go back to the original prompt, modify it to say that the table rows must be able to be dynamically reordered without affecting subtotals"
    - BrainMaxxing should allow a user to subscribe to change in other organizational BrainLifts (deltas appear in my feed with a link to the BL)
      - For example, our internal BrainLift on 0-1 prototyping
- Key terms:
  - BrainLift: core human knowledge data structure
  - BrainMaxxing: core knowledge creation process
