Software Design Principles in AI-augmented Development

- Purpose
  - To redefine software design principles for AI-augmented development, focusing on how semantic abstractions outperform traditional technical abstractions like SOLID.
  - This BrainLift captures expertise in creating code that remains highly maintainable while being optimized for both human comprehension and AI context windows.
  - It challenges established software engineering dogma by prioritizing domain-oriented organization over pattern-based abstractions, ultimately delivering superior long-term maintainability and development velocity in AI-assisted environments.

  - Semantic cohesion outperforms technical abstraction in AI-first development.
    - Code that tells the complete story in one place over separated concerns.
    - Functions with 50-100 lines of semantically coherent code over 5-10 line "clean" functions scattered across files.
- DOK3 - Insights
  - Systems with fewer technical abstractions but stronger semantic organization present a more immediately comprehensible structure to both humans and AI.

    - Pre-AI software design principles focused on technical organization of the code over semantic clarity. Principles optimized for such constraints hinder AI-first development. This represents a paradigm shift with AI readability becoming a primary concern alongside human readability.
    - Code bases with fewer, more semantically meaningful abstractions often demonstrate better long-term maintainability metrics.
  - DOK1 - facts
    - LLMs have finite context windows that limit the amount of code they can process at once.
    - Each additional layer of abstraction consumes context window space with boilerplate, imports, and relationship definitions.
    - Empirical studies show that strict SOLID adherence can increase initial code size by 30-70% compared to more direct implementations.
    - Industry surveys indicate that while 87% of teams claim to follow SOLID principles, only 24% strictly implement all five principles consistently.
    - LLMs generate more accurate code when domain concepts are clearly articulated in variable and function names.
    - Studies show that AI tools generate 45% fewer errors when completing code organized semantically versus technically.
