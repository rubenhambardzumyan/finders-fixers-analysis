  - Learn the best practices of using AI in daily maintenance work
  - Out of scope:
    - Compare between LLM models
    - Compare between AI tools
- DOK4 - SPOV
  - Engineers should delegate code creation to AI and evolve into high-leverage reviewers.
  - Engineers must generate test cases using AI and focus on refining and validating those cases.
- DOK3 - Insights
  - AI Significantly Enhances Automation, But Context and Human Judgment Remain Critical Gaps
  - AI’s Value in Legacy Code Lies in Pattern Recognition, Not Deep System Understanding
- Knowledge tree
  - AI in Automation for Coding and Testing
    - DOK1 – Facts
      - AI-driven tools generate and prioritize software test cases.
      - AI can quickly scaffold E2E test scripts from code changes, user stories, or UI recordings.
      - AI can automatically detect and fix bugs in codebases.
    - DOK2 – Summaries
      - AI excels at detecting bugs, generating test cases, and scaffolding E2E test scripts from code changes or requirements—reducing manual effort and accelerating development cycles.
  - AI for Legacy Code Comprehension
    - DOK1 – Facts
      - AI can reverse-engineer undocumented legacy code by identifying patterns and dependencies.
      - AI struggles without documentation or original developer context.
      - Tightly coupled legacy components make safe AI-driven refactoring difficult.
    - DOK2 – Summaries
      - AI can reverse-engineer undocumented systems by spotting structural patterns, but it struggles when lacking documentation or institutional knowledge, especially in tightly coupled systems.
  - AI Limitations in Human-Centric and Visual Evaluation
    - DOK1 – Facts
      - AI cannot reliably test features requiring human judgment, like UI/UX aesthetics or usability.
      - Visual regressions, accessibility issues, and responsive layout bugs often evade AI detection.
    - DOK2 – Summaries
      - Tasks like UI/UX evaluation, accessibility validation, and detecting layout regressions often require human perception, where AI tools remain unreliable.
  - AI Gaps in Contextual and Environmental Awareness
    - DOK1 – Facts
      - AI cannot interact with or validate client environments where real-world data, permissions, or integrations are involved.
    - DOK2 – Summaries
      - AI can't effectively simulate or validate real-world scenarios involving client-specific data, integrations, or permissions—leading to blind spots in critical testing.
