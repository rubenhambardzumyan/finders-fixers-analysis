- _----------- Depth of Knowledge / DOK starts here ----------_
- DOK4 - SPOV
  - Spreadfast / Publishing
    - AI-powered publishing is now just the cost of entry in social marketing platforms. The battle is no longer about who has AI, but about who enables brands to orchestrate, measure, and govern publishing across the entire customer journey. Spredfast/Khoros One must lead with workflow intelligence and unified insights—not just smarter scheduling.
  - Care
    - If AI can directly handle a substantial portion of conversations, it could potentially reduce the need for human intervention and, by extension, the platform's USPs.
    - AI will convert care into a AI-human workflows orchestrator
      - Spiky POV: As AI takes over routine customer interactions, the true strategic value of Khoros Care shifts from boosting agent productivity to orchestrating seamless AI-human workflows. The platform’s future isn’t about making agents faster, but about acting as the intelligent ‘air traffic control system’ that decides which conversations stay with AI, which escalate to humans, and how context transfers flawlessly between them. In a world of multiplying AI agents and engagement channels, Khoros Care’s unique advantage becomes its ability to master the handoff: routing, timing, and context—making the platform more essential, not less, as AI adoption accelerates.
    - Pricing should penalize platform fragmentation
      - Spiky POV: Instead of competing on simplicity, make fragmented solutions expensive. Charge customers MORE if they want to use Khoros alongside other platforms. Create pricing incentives that reward full platform adoption and penalize partial implementations. Make the unified approach not just better, but economically inevitable.
- DOK3 - Insights
  - Spredfast / Publishing
    - Spredfast has been in maintenance mode for months/years
      - no new feature
      - no dev
      - only integrations work
    - Publishing (NGP) is still not release to customers and has gaps
    - The reason to move from Spreadfast to NGP in K1 is to
      - For customres
        - unify the UX, training learning curve is less steep
        - single authentication
        - not moving from one tool to another
        - there's value to reply to customers from the same interface
      - For Khoros
        - Cost of the infrastructure
        - Only deployed in the US
        - Compliance (only US deployment)
  - Care
    - Khoros Care orchestrates high-volume, multi-channel interactions to optimize agent capacity and service quality.
      - Khoros Care is a highly valued platform for its ability to serve as a single pane of glass, enabling agents to efficiently manage high conversation volumes, multiple languages, and diverse channels without disrupting workflow or losing context. This capability is particularly important for high-volume service teams, where it is not just about having omnichannel capability, but also about achieving mastery of workload. A good analogy would be an air traffic control system for customer conversations, where just as air traffic controllers coordinate multiple aircraft across different altitudes, speeds, and destinations while ensuring safe and efficient flow, Khoros Care orchestrates customer interactions across various channels, languages, and complexity levels while optimizing agent capacity and maintaining service quality.
    - Khoros Care's primary competitive advantage (unified high-volume platform) aligns perfectly with the volume-based pricing model, but the pricing complexity is a genuine competitive weakness that needs addressing.
    - CRM Integration: Data Plumbing, Not AI Value
      - Input: Pulls customer context from external CRMs into Care
      - Output: Pushes Care conversation outcomes back to CRMs
      - Function: Data synchronization, not intelligence

        - Learning Loop: Agent feedback improves AI suggestions and expert routing over time.
      - DOK2 Analysis:
        - This use-case eliminates the agent productivity pain of "knowledge hunting" where agents spend significant time searching for information while customers wait. The expert consultation addresses the escalation dilemma where agents either provide incorrect information or create delays transferring to specialists. This targets Community-First Organizations and Enterprise customers with deep technical knowledge requirements, preventing the common scenario where expertise bottlenecks create service delays and reducing the training time needed for new agents to deliver expert-level responses.
    - Use-Case 8: Comprehensive Analytics & Performance Management
      - DOK1 Facts:
        - Unified Reporting Platform: Single analytics dashboard covering marketing performance, agent productivity, and customer satisfaction.
        - Real-Time Dashboards: Live monitoring of queue depths, response times, and agent availability.
        - Cross-Channel Attribution: Complete view of customer journey from marketing touchpoint to service resolution.
        - Predictive Analytics: Forecasting for staffing, campaign impact, and service volume planning.
        - Customizable KPIs: Role-specific metrics and reporting for different organizational levels.
      - DOK2 Analysis:
        - This use-case addresses the management pain of "analytics fragmentation" where decision-makers cannot get unified views of customer engagement performance across marketing and service functions. The comprehensive approach eliminates the common scenario where teams optimize for their individual metrics while missing cross-functional impact and customer journey optimization opportunities. This targets all customer segments but particularly benefits Enterprise Multi-Product Customers who need board-level reporting and data-driven decision making, enabling strategic alignment between marketing investment and service delivery while identifying revenue protection and growth opportunities.
  - ==Business model and pricing==
    - ## Primary Revenue Drivers
      - ### DOK1 Facts:
        - **Platform Costs**: Not tied to seats but to content ingestion pace, monetized via channel bundles (Social, Digital, Reviews, Messages, Yelp)
        - **Alternative Pricing Models**:
          - Volume-based charging by inbound conversations and outbound responses
          - Conversation retention periods (1-7 years based on regulatory requirements)
        - **Social Network Fees**: Fixed fees (Twitter) bundled into platform cost; variable fees (WhatsApp, Review Trackers, Yelp) passed through
        - **User/Seats**: Becomes factor only after 100+ seats, with concurrent and flex seat alternatives
        - **Community Pricing**: Visits (page views by unique users), message/post volume, and content size
        - **Automation Costs**: Scale directly with conversation volume regardless of channel
      - ### DOK2 Analysis:
        - The primary revenue driver is **content/conversation volume** rather than traditional seat-based licensing. This consumption-based model aligns with customer value realization - customers pay based on their actual platform usage and engagement levels. The shift from seat-based to volume-based pricing reflects the platform's core value proposition of managing high-volume social interactions efficiently.
        - The multi-tiered approach (platform + network fees + automation + seats) creates revenue diversification but also complexity. Channel bundles provide predictable revenue while variable network fees ensure cost pass-through for external dependencies.
    - ## Pricing-Value Alignment by Customer Segment
      - ### DOK1 Facts:
        - **Entry-Level Community**: Proposed baseline of 10,000 users and 100,000 posts with user limitations as "protection against abusive scaling"
        - **App Server Scaling**: Need to add nodes once customers exceed 50 seats, with single-node limitations for 10-20 seat entry offerings
        - **Analytics Retention**: Currently 2 years, planned reduction to 6 months for starter/emerging enterprise with extended history as paid add-on
        - **Integration Marketplace**: New revenue stream with 4-9 integrations per customer expected, monthly subscription basis
      - ### DOK2 Analysis:
        - **Well-Aligned Value:**
          - **Volume-based pricing** directly correlates with customer engagement success - higher social activity generates more revenue for both customer and Khoros
          - **Conversation retention tiers** align with regulatory compliance needs, allowing customers to pay only for required retention periods
          - **Integration marketplace** creates value-added revenue where customers pay for specific functionality they need
        - **Misaligned Areas:**
          - **Seat-based components** don't reflect actual platform value for high-automation customers who may need fewer agents but higher conversation volumes
          - **Channel bundling** may force customers to pay for channels they don't actively use
          - **Infrastructure scaling** (app server costs) may not be transparent to customers, creating unexpected cost increases
        - **Emerging Opportunities:**
          - **Network fee pass-through model** positions Khoros to maintain margins regardless of social platform pricing changes
          - **Tiered analytics retention** allows value-based pricing where compliance-heavy industries pay premium for longer data retention
          - **Entry-level tiers** with usage caps provide clear upgrade paths as customer volume grows
    - ## Revenue Model Sustainability
      - ### DOK1 Facts:
        - **Cost Structure**: Infrastructure costs scale with usage (app servers, content storage, API calls)
        - **Network Dependencies**: External fees from social platforms create variable cost structure
        - **Professional Services**: Custom development and migration services provide additional revenue streams
      - ### DOK2 Analysis:
        - The pricing model shows strong alignment with value delivery in high-usage scenarios but faces challenges:
        - **Strengths:**
          - Consumption-based pricing scales with customer success and engagement growth
          - Pass-through network fees protect Khoros from external cost increases
          - Multiple revenue streams reduce dependency on any single pricing mechanism
        - **Risks:**
          - Complex pricing structure with "extreme amount of SKUs" creates sales friction
          - Infrastructure scaling costs may outpace revenue growth for inefficient usage patterns
          - Heavy reliance on social network API access creates revenue vulnerability
          - The shift toward volume-based pricing with clear usage tiers represents better value alignment than traditional seat-based models, particularly for the social engagement use case where success is measured by interaction volume rather than user count.
  - ==Architecture==
    - ## Deployment Footprints
      - ### DOK1 Facts:
        - **Primary Cloud**: AWS across 3 regions (US West 2/Oregon, EU West 1/Ireland, AP Southeast 2/Sydney)
        - **Multi-Cloud Exceptions**:
          - Microsoft Azure deployment for Microsoft as customer (Community product only)
          - Google Cloud Platform deployment for Google as customer (Community product only)
        - **Regional Separation**: Regions intentionally don't communicate with each other for data sovereignty
        - **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Logically-separated data and access controls within shared infrastructure
        - **Community-Specific Tool**: "RC" (deployment tool) provides abstraction layer across clouds for Community product
      - ### DOK2 Analysis:
        - The deployment strategy reflects a "cloud-agnostic by exception" approach - Khoros is fundamentally an AWS shop but accommodates specific enterprise customers' cloud requirements for Community deployments. The regional isolation strategy enables GDPR compliance and data residency requirements while the multi-tenant approach provides cost efficiency. The minimal Azure/GCP footprints (described as "small, small") indicate these are customer-specific accommodations rather than strategic multi-cloud investments.
    - ## AWS Account Structure
      - ### DOK1 Facts:
        - **Organization Structure**: Brand organization split into non-production and production OUs (Organizational Units)
        - **Account Separation by Product**:
          - Care Development/Production accounts
          - Community Development/Analytics accounts
          - Legacy Spredfast product accounts
          - Minor shared services accounts
        - **Environment Strategy**: Dev/QA in development accounts; Stage/Pre-prod/Prod in production accounts
        - **Network Isolation**: Fully separated at network layer - "I don't want Dev talking to prod"
        - **Access Management**: AWS Single Sign-On with role-based access by job function
      - ### DOK2 Analysis:
        - The account structure follows AWS best practices with clear environment and product boundaries. The separation by product rather than just environment enables independent scaling and security policies per product line. The choice to separate dev/prod by account rather than just VPC provides stronger security isolation, particularly important for a SaaS platform handling customer data across multiple tenants.
    - ## High-Level Architecture and Building Blocks
      - ### DOK1 Facts:
        - **Khoros One Architecture**: Service-based architecture with asynchronous processing, APIs, and AI/ML components
        - **Data Flow Pipeline**:
          - **Ingest**: API-based channel integration, normalization, real-time integration
          - **Normalize**: Data lake, author/content normalization, indexing, streaming
          - **Enrich**: Filtering, routing, sentiment/intent/language detection, redaction
          - **Workflows**: Content planning/publishing, case management, moderation, bot design
        - **Community Engine**: API-driven customization platform with web UX, APIs, and developer experience layers
        - **Integration Protocols**: GraphQL APIs, REST endpoints, real-time event firehose
      - ### DOK2 Analysis:
