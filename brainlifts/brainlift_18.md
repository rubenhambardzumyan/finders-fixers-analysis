    - Move everything to AWS. We are AWS first and always prefer AWS over other clouds or co-location. This is a fact driven by a top-down decision, not an insight.
    - We frequently buy bad companies: poorly managed or bankrupt. We believe we can turn them around by applying standard processes
    - AWS does not fail. Period. HA is a thing only if contractually required
