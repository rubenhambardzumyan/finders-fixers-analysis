BL: BLCoach Adoption Strategy

# Owner(s):

- Ruben Hambardzumyan ( [ruben.hambardzumyan@trilogy.com](mailto:ruben.hambardzumyan@trilogy.com))

# Purpose

- The purpose of this BrainLift is to create the adoption strategy of the BrainLift Coach product so that it helps users to create great BrainLifts. The goal of this BrainLift is to acquire 500 active (those users who make at least one change in their BrainLift every day) Trilogy users (engineers and product managers first) in 30 days from the moment of the official launch.

# DOK4 - SPOVs

- **[4.1] DOK4 - SPOV: **Software companies with traditional knowledge management that are not embracing the concept of BrainLifting are doomed to extinction.
- **[4.2] DOK4 - SPOV: **BrainLift adoption requires starting with power users who become internal champions before expanding, rather than attempting broad rollout that risks high churn from users feeling overwhelmed.
- **[4.3] DOK4 - SPOV: **Effective onboarding must focus on making users feel they can "win" with BrainLifts rather than just demonstrating features, addressing emotional barriers that cause churn when users feel "dumb, overwhelmed, or like outsiders."

# DOK3 - Insights

- **[3.1] DOK3 - Insight:** Successful product adoption requires a clearly defined user journey with objective metrics focused on customer value rather than feature usage, allowing product managers to identify where users get stuck and proactively address gaps.
- **[3.2] DOK3 - Insight: **Limiting initial user numbers until demonstrating success with a small cohort prevents "burning users like a meat grinder," creating a foundation of success stories before opening adoption floodgates.
- **[3.3] DOK3 - Insight: **User feedback mechanisms must be designed for definitive rather than inferred signals, incorporating simple binary options that capture clear user sentiment rather than relying on ambiguous engagement metrics.

# Experts

- **James Clear**
  - Who: Author of "Atomic Habits"
  - Main views & unique SPOVs:

  - Why follow:

    - James Clear believes habit formation requires environmental design and systematic building from small routines, strongly supporting your approach to embed BrainLift creation into daily workflow rather than treating it as optional tool usage. His emphasis on "applying pressure instead of avoiding it" aligns with your controversial stance that knowledge tools must force users to continuously destroy and rebuild understanding rather than passively preserve information.

    - Samuel's core belief that "users are not buying products, they are buying better versions of themselves" directly supports your controversial onboarding strategy focused on making users feel they can "win" with BrainLifts rather than just showing features. His emphasis on emotional engagement over functional demonstration aligns with your approach to combat user churn from feeling "dumb, overwhelmed, or like outsiders."

  - Alignment: High alignment with user-centric onboarding principles.
- **Clayton Christensen**
  - Who: Late author of "Innovator's Dilemma"
  - Main views & unique SPOVs: True disruption comes from below by serving needs the dominant players ignore
  - Why follow:
    - His books are about innovation adoption which can help to derive coaching strategies.
    - Christensen's theory that "true disruption comes from below by serving needs the dominant players ignore" supports your controversial strategy of starting with power users inside the company rather than broad market adoption. His disruption framework aligns with your belief that BrainLifts will "democratize expertise rather than create a caste system" by serving the underserved need for accessible structured thinking.
  - Where to find:
  - Alignment: Mostly aligned with disruption-from-below approach.
