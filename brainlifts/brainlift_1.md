BrainLift 3.0 - MarTech SMB Acquisition Playbook

- **Owner**
  - Brandon Pizzacalla
- **Purpose**
  - Establish an expert-backed playbook on how to acquire and operate lower left quadrant MarTech companies with SMB customers and monthly contracts, while maintaining vital aspects of the traditional ESW playbook:
    - 75% net margin
    - 100% customer success (not happiness)
  - Instead of requiring aggressive price increases that are unlikely to work for low-stickiness monthly customers, we aim to establish an alternative pricing and packaging strategy that still achieves 90%+ net dollar retention ("NDR" or "NRR")
- **Exec Summary**
  - This playbook demonstrates how we can acquire SMB-centric MarTech businesses and, without relying on blunt price hikes, transform them into 75%-margin, 90%+ NRR performers. We layer in LLMO discovery and outcome-based AI features, run continuous pricing and packaging experiments, automate support and renewals, and bundle data-rich products for a single marketing buyer—preserving 100% customer success while unlocking durable expansion.
- **DOK4 - SPOVs**
  - **Even with SMB customers: Double prices and achieve 100%+ NDR by adding must-have AI value first. ** Interview customers, build the quickest high‑ROI features they beg for (ideally outcome‑priced AI), ship them, then raise prices. The extra value masks the hike and lifts ARPU 2x. Outcome‑metered AI keeps spend rising as usage (and value) climbs.
    - DOK3: Increase prices by 2x by interviewing customers to determine the easiest high-value features to add, then add them right as you increase prices.
    - DOK3: AI features must be value focused, where increasing usage increases customer value and therefore drives spending over time
  - **The future of all marketing (i) exists at the intersection of humans and AI chat tools, and/or (ii) will be targeting AI Agents directly.** Soon everyone will use AI for informational and transactional search because it's a 10x better experience than Google. AI agents will become responsible for commercial investigation search, making autonomous purchasing decisions by the end of 2026. Every MarTech product therefore needs an LLM‑Optimization / AI‑SEO layer to stay findable and protect NRR.
    - Support: [The entire LLMO BrainLift](https://workflowy.com/s/brainlift-30-llmo/WsVAonAyHvfWipvY)
  - **Relentlessly pursue outcome-metered AI features to add 45+ pp to NRR.** Every MarTech acquisition should have a plan for continuous innovation on AI features that support billing for outcomes. It increases NRR short term, but also protects NRR long term if competitors bundle your older features into core tiers (because you release a new outcome-priced feature).
    - DOK3: Monetize AI aggressively in the first 1‑2 years before AI features become standard and surcharges are untenable.
    - DOK3: Hybrid embedded‑premium pricing is the safest way to raise prices without too much churn.
  - **Pricing/Packaging updates can increase NRR in 100% of MarTech acquisitions with large SMB customer bases in under 2 quarters.** With 1000+ customers we can run perpetual A/B tests on pricing and packaging to drive a 14%+ NRR lift and convert monthly subs to annual.
    - DOK3: Quarterly price experimentation is uniquely feasible in large SMB cohorts and reliably adds ~14 % NDR.
    - DOK3: Hybrid embedded‑premium pricing is the safest way to raise prices without too much churn.
  - **AI provides the path to "segment-of-one" GTM and product features. **AI can generate dynamic micro-content for every audience slice, which is valuable for GTM, customer success, and new MarTech product features. All of these provide high-margin paths to increased NRR.
    - DOK3: AI customer success can be used as an upsell engine, surfacing expansion insights in real time and allowing automated growth.
    - DOK2: AI can be used to create 1-1 content and experiences for people at near zero cost
  - **100% of Customer Support and Renewals can be handled by AI Agents, removing all Support a nd Renewal Central Function costs. **AI agents will deliver a better customer experience than web portals or human agents, removing renewal fiction and driving upsells while never deviating from our playbook. This also frees up 3 points of margin to run pricing & packaging experiments.
  - **Every legacy team member / role can be replaced by an AI-first hire that doesn't necessarily have previous experience or specialization in such role.** The best AI-first hires can quickly build expertise and automate meaningful portions of legacy roles, allowing the company to operate with a fraction of historical HC costs.
    - Keep Eng for now. DOK3: Central engineering / Kanbans are still required
- **DOK3 - Insights**
  - We must monetize AI aggressively in the first 1-2 years before AI features become standard and surcharges for AI are untenable. Shifting to outcome based pricing reduces this potential transition.
    - DOK2: Ibaaka blog - Outcome based pricing works for AI models where a company can deliver an outcome. A step further than usage based pricing and aligns closer to business value.
  - AI features must be value focused, where increasing usage increases customer value and therefore drives spending over time
    - DOK2: Increase NDR by aligning usage pricing to customer value
  - Increase prices by 2x by interviewing customers to determine the easiest high-value features to add, then add them right as you increase prices.
    - DOK2: Successfully increase prices on a monthly sub base by deeply interviewing the customer base and increasing product value first
    - DOK2: Use AI features to focus pricing on value-based structures, charging a premium attached to business value
  - Hybrid embedded-premium pricing is the safest way to raise prices without too much churn. Add AI to all existing tiers and implement a modest price increase (or usage cap, and charge for usage upside)
    - DOK2: Investing in premium customer success (e.g. paid onboarding, consulting, support tiers) can significantly reduce churn
    - DOK2: Increase NDR by aligning usage pricing to customer value
  - Bundling + seat simplification (i.e. pricing and packages) is the most repeatable NRR lever in MarTech. Create easy to understand value dense packages with clear paths to frictionless upsell.
    - DOK2: Hubspot / Mailchimp
  - Prime is 10x more effective at protecting NRR when all products can be sold to the same marketing team, rather than across org silos.\*\* \*\*The business value of a MarTech product suite is measurable to a single team and likely to a single SVP, improving probability of renewal and ability to increase prices.
    - DOK3: Bundling + seat simplification is the most repeatable NRR lever in MarTech.
    - DOK3: Usage‑based components lift NRR ~1.5×, but only when the usage metric is tied to customer value and frictionless to grow.
  - MarTech data exhaust is gold dust that can be productized. Aggregate passive telemetry from a bundle of MarTech products and package it as anonymized benchmarks and predictive insights. These unique insights can be upsold to drive NRR and create stickier products.
    - DOK3: Data‑exhaust monetisation is the overlooked upsell for low‑stickiness SMB bases.
    - DOK3: Margin & NRR are complementary, not competing goals when AI reduces COGS.
  - Usage‑based components lift NRR ~1.5×, but only when the usage metric is tied to customer value and frictionless to grow.
    - DOK2: McKinsey 1.5x, Snowflake 171% NRR hybird model
  - Data‑exhaust monetisation is the overlooked upsell for low‑stickiness SMB bases.
    - DOK2: Bessemer
  - AI customer success can be used as an upsell engine, surfacing expansion insights in real time and allowing automated growth
    - DOK2: Gainsight
  - Quarterly price experimentation (at minimum) is uniquely feasible in large SMB cohorts and reliably adds ~14 % NDR.
    - DOK2: Profitwell / paddle
  - Margin & NRR are complementary, not competing goals when AI reduces COGS. Replace internal costs to fund usage-based upsell credits and hit 75%+ margin tarets
  - Central engineering / Kanbans are still required to maintain the existing code base, including refactoring, stabilizing, cost savings, upgrades, and bug fixes. Monthly customers have zero patience for outages because they aren't stuck in a contract.
  - Central CPM team could expand role and more actively participate in product management, including tier optimization, feature strategy, user base segmentation etc.
  - In any low growth company, improving NRR is the biggest lever to drive revenue and IRR
    - DOK2: Use Max MRR to predict future MRR / churn has the largest impact on Max MRR

      - **DOK2 Summary:** Mailchimp used new features (adding value) + positioning to overhaul pricing and increased revenues by 20%
      - DOK1s:
        - “It introduced new tiered plans (Essentials, Standard, Premium) … changed the pricing metric from subscribed contacts to total contacts … including unsubscribed ones … eliminated unlimited email sends; each tier came with monthly send limits. Mailchimp grandfathered existing customers on legacy plans to ease the transition.”
        - “Mailchimp’s revenue jumped to $800 million in 2020, up ~20% year-over-year. This suggests that the new multi-channel capabilities (and corresponding pricing) unlocked more spending from customers, offsetting those who left. By 2020, half of Mailchimp’s revenue came from non-email services … Mailchimp was acquired for $12B, with Intuit citing its expanded marketing functionality as a key asset.”
        - “Mailchimp introduced CRM tools, websites, and AI features alongside new pricing. SaaS firms raising prices should showcase new benefits to justify the change.”

      - **DOK2 Summary:** Hubspot simplified pricing across entire product base and drove NRR from 90% to 110%
      - DOK1s:
        - By 2021, HubSpot’s NRR surpassed 110%, up from the mid-90s% in prior years. Analysts attributed this increase to multi-Hub adoption, which the pricing changes made more natural. HubSpot’s CFO expects NRR to remain above 110%, indicating the new model’s potential for long-term upsells.
        - The SaaS industry praised HubSpot’s simplification, with one analyst noting, ‘110% NRR from SMBs – finally.’ The shift was seen as a long-overdue move that unlocks more revenue from SMBs without harming retention.
        - HubSpot justified its pricing shift by emphasizing: … Access to all Hubs via core seats. … Inclusion of new AI features. … Lower costs for scaling businesses. By openly communicating the rationale, HubSpot avoided backlash and ensured the narrative remained positive.”

        - One of the powers of vibe marketing is having AI dynamically generate content for the prospect.
        - here are lots of dimensions that segment buyers (I care about academics, no I care about sports, etc) and we can have a dynamic AI powered website that generates content specifically for them.
        - Just as we hate chatbots for academics - adding a chatbot to a website is lame.  We generate dynamic content for super personalized for students, we should generate dynamic content for parents coming to our website.

      - **DOK2 Summary: **Use AI features to focus pricing on value-based structures, charging a premium attached to business value
      - DOK1s:
        - Generative AI (GenAI) fundamentally shifts SaaS pricing from seat-based to outcome-/value-driven models… Emerging pricing models are either outcome-based (pay per result), consumption-based (pay per usage) or hybrid subscription models combining fixed fees with variable AI components.

      - **DOK2 Summary: **First, try to attach AI to customer value. If that's not possible, you can use an "embedded AI premium" (i.e. not a separate line item). This creates a route for upsell / increasing NRR.
      - DOK1s:
        - Where GenAI variable cost is in play but is not directly correlated with customer value, ‘capped packages’ or ‘embedded AI premium’ are two suggested approaches… In the ‘embedded AI premium’ approach…the vendor will increase the price point, reflecting the enhanced value brought by GenAI – … GenAI is not a separate entity on the price list but an integral part of the improved offering.
        - Lever for upsell: By providing additional GenAI usage at a premium cost, SaaS companies can create opportunities to upsell customers who require additional consumption… Assuming that additional usage…provides incremental value, it may become the new recurring revenue baseline for that customer.

      - **DOK2 Summary:** Pricing and packaging is a first-class growth lever that should be reviewed every 3-12 months. It is always relative to customer value and likely has usage-based aspects. Optimize for NDR, but always consider margins when making decisions.
        - DOK1s
          - pricing has the greatest impact on revenue, reducing acquisition costs and improving retention
          - Update it annually
          - companies connecting their product to user value will always outperform their peers -> anchor every change to customer value, not cost or competitors
          - Customer value could be usage based pricing, or grouping my core use cases
            - Surface in app / in email ROI calculators so customers self-justify the upgrade
          - Focus on NRR (NDR), but model LTV by cohort to figure out high-support customers stand out
          - Reverse trials (paid team features for 14 days, then freemium or turn off) can improve conversion
          - Design any freemium plans for margin (gate any expensive features behind paywall)

      - **DOK2 Summary: **Focus immediately on a pricing & packaging analysis, including true localization, to drive 14%+ NRR
      - DOK1s:
        - Pricing **and** packaging is one of the fastest and cheapest way to impact revenue growth, driving 14% increase in NDR
        - True pricing localization accounts for willingness to pay and can increase overall revenue and NDR

      - **DOK2 Summary: **Increase NDR by aligning usage pricing to customer value
      - DOK1s:
        - Combining Subscription, Usage, and Services for Maximum SaaS Revenue
        - Subscription is the foundation - predictable recurring revenue
        - Incorporating usage-based elements allows companies to capture additional revenue from power users while offering lower entry points for new or smaller customers.
        - McKinsey research shows that companies implementing usage-based components see a 1.5x higher net dollar retention rate compared to subscription-only businesses.
          - Aligns revenue directly with customer value realization
          - Enables monetization of increased adoption
          - Creates natural upsell opportunities without sales intervention
        - CASE: Snowflake's Consumption-Subscription Hybrid
          - Snowflake combines a reserved capacity subscription model with consumption-based pricing. Customers commit to minimum spending levels (subscription) while having the flexibility to use more (consumption) during peak periods. This approach has helped Snowflake maintain a remarkable 171% net revenue retention rate as of Q2 2023.

      - **DOK2 Summary:** Two pricing tweaks – usage-based add-ons and tier/anchor strategies – can unlock more expansion revenue per customer. Make sure to commercialize all aspects of the product, like data exhaust.
      - DOK1s:
