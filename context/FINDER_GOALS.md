# Finder Goals - BrainLift Quality Assessment

## PUR Finder Goal
**Purpose Statement Assessment**

This Finder evaluates whether a BrainLift has a clear, actionable purpose that defines what problem it solves and why it matters.

• Looks for background context explaining why the problem is important to solve
• Identifies whether there's a clear problem statement (or set of sub-problems) being addressed
• Checks for measurable outcomes with specific business-related metrics
• Verifies scope definition - what's included vs excluded from the domain
• Ensures the purpose drives expertise development toward solving real problems, not just knowledge accumulation

## EXP Finder Goal
**Expert Network Assessment**

This Finder assesses whether the BrainLift creator has identified and documented the right voices to learn from in their domain.

• Identifies domain experts (people, organizations, websites, mailing lists) who produce valuable sources
• Looks for diverse perspectives to avoid echo chambers
• Checks that each expert entry includes:
  - Name and occupation
  - Their main SPOVs related to the BrainLift's purpose
  - Clear reasoning for why following them contributes to expertise development
  - Explicit agreement/disagreement notes from the BrainLift creator
  - Proper attribution with links/URLs
• Ensures the expert list helps "filter the internet" to relevant, high-quality sources

## DOK1 Finder Goal
**Facts Collection Assessment**

This Finder evaluates whether the BrainLift contains objective, verifiable facts that form the foundation of expertise.

• Looks for facts extracted from primary sources within the Knowledge Tree
• Verifies facts are objective - the same for anyone reading the source
• Checks that facts are specific and verifiable with proper source attribution
• Ensures facts avoid obvious, common knowledge statements
• Identifies the boundaries of current knowledge in the domain
• Flags areas where experts disagree about evolution vs revolution in the field

## DOK2 Finder Goal
**Knowledge Synthesis Assessment**

This Finder assesses whether the BrainLift creator is effectively synthesizing information from sources into coherent summaries.

• Evaluates summaries within the Knowledge Tree structure
• Looks for logical connections explaining HOW or WHY something occurs
• Verifies summaries demonstrate direct causality and logical chaining
• Ensures summaries are objective and directly supported by DOK1 facts
• Checks that summaries synthesize key concepts into coherent explanations
• Notes whether summaries align with SPOVs (when present) while remaining grounded in facts

## DOK3 Finder Goal
**Insight Development Assessment**

This Finder evaluates whether the BrainLift contains strategic insights that bridge multiple sources and domains.

• Looks for practical rules of thumb applicable to real situations
• Identifies surprising or counterintuitive patterns across multiple sources
• Verifies insights are grounded in underlying DOK1 facts and DOK2 summaries
• Ensures insights provide enough foundation to form SPOVs and decisions
• Checks that insights go beyond obvious statements to provide genuine value
• Assesses whether insights help solve the BrainLift's stated problem

## DOK4 Finder Goal
**Spiky Point of View (SPOV) Assessment**

This Finder evaluates whether the BrainLift contains actionable, controversial SPOVs that represent new knowledge creation.

• Looks for clear, dense statements capturing the creator's unique worldview
• Verifies SPOVs are controversial enough to force readers to take a stance
• Ensures SPOVs are actionable rules that guide decision-making
• Checks that SPOVs go beyond common sense or default AI responses
• Verifies each SPOV is grounded in 2+ DOK3 insights
• Assesses whether SPOVs represent genuine new knowledge that pushes beyond current boundaries
• Ensures SPOVs guide how to solve the problem stated in the BrainLift's purpose
