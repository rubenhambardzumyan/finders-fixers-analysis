## What is a BrainLift?

A BrainLift is your personal expertise translator — a structured format that captures your professional knowledge so AI can think like you, work like you, and deliver results that actually matter to your specific job.

Unlike traditional documentation, a BrainLift is designed for both human and AI consumption, creating true collaboration between your expertise and AI's capabilities.

## Core Structure

BrainLifts are organized using the DOK (Depth of Knowledge) framework:

- **DOK1 - Facts**: Objective, verifiable information from external sources
- **DOK2 - Summaries**: Synthesis of multiple facts from a source, capturing key patterns
- **DOK3 - Insights**: Your subjective patterns across multiple sources
- **DOK4 - SPOVs**: Spiky Points of View - your definitive stances that guide decisions

## Key Components

### Purpose Statement

Must include:

- **Specificity**: Define the exact problem or decision area
- **Clear Boundaries**: State what's in scope and out of scope
- **Personal Relevance**: Connect to YOUR work deliverables

### Knowledge Areas

2-4 focused domains where you need deep knowledge to achieve your work outcomes. Each should be:

- Specific enough to guide content collection
- Directly supportive of your purpose
- Narrow enough for deep expertise but broad enough to be valuable

### DOK Levels Explained

**DOK1 - Facts**

- Objective, verifiable information
- Include specific details (numbers, dates, names)
- Clear source attribution
- Example: "React's virtual DOM implementation reduces browser reflows by 73% compared to direct DOM manipulation (React Performance Study, 2023)"

**DOK2 - Summaries**

- Synthesis of multiple DOK1 facts
- Your comprehension of how facts connect
- Remains objective but shows understanding
- Example: "React 18's concurrent rendering model fundamentally changes update scheduling by making rendering interruptible and automatically batching state updates"

**DOK3 - Insights**

- Your patterns discovered across multiple sources
- Connect contradictions, causes, and effects
- Reveal non-obvious patterns that challenge conventional thinking
- Example: "Teams that implement automated testing before writing production code consistently deliver features with 40% fewer critical bugs"

**DOK4 - SPOVs**

- Your definitive stances that guide decisions
- Debatable positions that others might disagree with
- Action-guiding and evidence-based
- Example: "ALWAYS validate feature ideas with at least 5 customers before adding them to the roadmap. No exceptions."

## Quality Criteria

### Strong SPOVs Should Be:

- **Contrarian**: Challenge conventional wisdom
- **Resistance-inducing**: Make people uncomfortable with the "old way"
- **Boundary-pushing**: Venture beyond conventional knowledge
- **Transformative**: Have the potential to change how work is done

### Strong Insights Should:

- Present surprising or contrarian patterns
- Transcend multiple sources
- Represent strategic synthesis, not just analysis
- Be supported by your DOK1 facts and DOK2 summaries

## How BrainLifts Transform AI Interactions

**Without BrainLift**: You give AI long instructions, clarify background, restate goals, and still correct misunderstandings.

**With BrainLift**: You ask natural, high-level questions. AI draws on your knowledge, constraints, and decisions from your BrainLift to deliver context-aware, actionable answers.

## Success Indicators

A quality BrainLift should:

- Generate AI responses that are indistinguishable from your own thinking
- Surface non-obvious connections across Knowledge Areas
- Provide decision guidance aligned with your SPOVs
- Reduce time from question to actionable answer
- Reflect your unique perspective and expertise

**BrainLift** is a structured, evolving knowledge artifact that distills a team's domain expertise into a form that is immediately usable by AI systems **and** human teammates. It serves as both a _second brain_ and a _coaching layer_, guiding decision-making, knowledge reuse, and AI-augmented work execution.

It **translates how experts think and work** into patterns that LLMs can replicate — making expert-level decisions possible even for non-experts or new joiners. At maturity, it becomes the foundation for AI-driven coaching and work automation.

> Think of it as an operating system for expertise: enabling intelligent work by encoding what matters, why it matters, and how it should be done.
