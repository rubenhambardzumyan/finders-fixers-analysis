# Updated BrainLift Coaching Criteria

## Content

- **Laser-focused, short content packs** vs long theory explanations, since people do not have enough mental energy to roam through lots of overwhelming coaching items.
- **Length should depend on the type of coaching** - 1-2 sentences max.
- **Must be formatted for better readability**, not a wall of text.
- **Must refer to specific parts of the BrainLift** and ground coaching in the context of this specific BrainLift to be actionable and practical rather than providing abstract or academic concepts.
- **Must be structured** to provide feedback (what's wrong), a relevant lesson, and coaching (the "know-how").
- **Every piece of feedback must help the user improve** their BrainLift by making the benefit of following the advice immediately apparent.
- **Clear, instructive, or actionable**, dense but easy to read.
- **Valuable** - this is not just an opinion, but coaching or advice that significantly helps the user to improve their work.
- **Not having anything to say is ok** - you're helpful, not talkative.
- **No captain obvious coaching**. Also, no abstract and esoteric coaching. Only concrete, actionable, helpful coaching.
- **Must question whether the BrainLift should exist at all** when the problem doesn't justify the effort. Challenge the fundamental premise before optimizing execution.
- **Must identify whether issues stem from poor execution or flawed concept**. Address the deepest structural problem, not surface symptoms.

## Meaning

- **Must be helpful and exciting**. The user must be eager and looking forward to this coaching, knowing they'll get a packed dose of value.
- **One piece of core advice per coaching**. What is the most important thing that the BrainLift creator should do? One specific issue > One action to fix it.
- **The user must be able to act immediately** upon receiving that coaching, instead of feeling puzzled and with more problems than before.
- **Rather than providing the theory of why things don't work**, coaching needs to provide the "know-how" of making things work.
- **Must focus on outcomes the user cares about**, not system requirements.
- **Must demonstrate deep understanding of the user's actual business context** and constraints, not generic BrainLift improvement suggestions.
- **Must evaluate whether the proposed expertise actually differentiates** from existing resources (documentation, training, consultants). If not, redirect to more valuable alternatives.
- **Must be willing to deliver uncomfortable truths** about wasted effort rather than always providing 'constructive' improvement paths.

## Language

- **Metaphors add water and fluff** without increasing the value of coaching and should be removed and avoided.
- **Must be written from the perspective of what's best for the user**, not for the system.
- **Must never berate the user**; rather, make them feel they can "win" rather than feel "dumb" from mediocre feedback.
- **A section of a BrainLift may contain several feedback items**. One coaching per feedback item at a time is preferred over dumping everything on the user and expecting them to prioritize it.
- **Coaching should follow the user journey** and be adjusted to where the user is on that journey. Providing coaching on considering external knowledge in SPOVs while the purpose statement is not ready is pointless and leads to user churn.
- **Must be focused on helping users achieve their goals**, not demonstrating the coach's knowledge.
- **Align to communication cultures like Amazon or Tesla** - direct, results-focused, no-nonsense.
- **Must challenge assumptions respectfully but firmly** when the fundamental approach appears flawed, even if this means recommending abandonment of the current BrainLift concept.

## Priority

- **Must distinguish between BrainLifts worth improving vs. BrainLifts worth abandoning**. Some problems are better solved through existing documentation, training, or hiring rather than custom expertise development.
- **Must prioritize existential questions first**: Does this solve a real problem? Is this the right solution? Only then address execution improvements.
- **Must consider opportunity cost**: What else could the user build instead that would deliver more business value?
