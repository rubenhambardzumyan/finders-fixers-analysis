Journey - user milestones

### Principles

- Grounded in user defined goal
- Focused on outcomes
- Advocates for understanding of
  - current state
  - established/contrarial/disruptive POVs
  - knowledge stemming unrelated domains that is relevant in the given context
- Break down the problem into smaller actionable problems: a brainlift may work on more than one problem - e.g., (1) increase margin by (2) reducing churn, (3) using AI for customer success and (4) right-sizing AWS infra

### Journey

- **Milestone 1: Have a clear purpose**
  - Clear problem to solve
  - Clear user specific context (background) - constraints specific to the user's setup, important variables to maximize, variables that are not important at all (e.g., optimize quality, ignore cost as long as it is not wasteful)
  - Clear outcome to make happen - ideally metric-driven, where metric can be some form of business impact or how broadly will the brainlift be used (by whom, for what)
  - **Result**: well defined purpose
- **Milestone 2: Understand the current knowledge space relevant to the problem(s)**
  - Current knowledge space can be organized in a few ways, not all relevant for any problem
    - Schools of Thought
    - Paradigm Shifts & Disruption Points
      - What are the "before/after" moments in this domain? What assumptions are being challenged right now? Where do experts disagree about whether something is an evolution or revolution? This maps directly to finding the boundary of current knowledge.
  - **Result**:
    - Experts along with what are they known for and what the owner may agree or disagree with
    - First few (empty) knowledge areas
- **Milestone 3: Take a stance on important POVs (not to be confused with BL SPOVs)**
  - Starting from the user purpose and context, explore this from different angles:
    - Decisions are highly consequential for practitioners in this space (what you included above)
    - Fundamental Trade-offs & Tensions
      - Where opposing values create permanent tensions that can't be "solved" but only balanced differently. Examples: centralization vs. decentralization, speed vs. accuracy, standardization vs. customization. These are the places where your spiky POV can cut through analysis paralysis.
    - Unspoken Assumptions & Sacred Cows
      - What "everyone knows" but rarely examines? What questions are considered off-limits? These are prime targets for developing contrarian, spiky positions that AI would resist.
    - Insider vs. Outsider Perspectives
      - What do practitioners take for granted that outsiders question? Where do cross-domain insights challenge orthodox thinking? This is fertile ground for DOK4-level synthesis.
  - **Result**
    - Identified Experts within the domain
    - Books or Articles with important DOK1 Facts worth to be DOK2 Summarized
    - DOK3 Insights for high consequential POVs that the user agrees with
- **Milestone 4: Hone your Insights and SPOVs**
